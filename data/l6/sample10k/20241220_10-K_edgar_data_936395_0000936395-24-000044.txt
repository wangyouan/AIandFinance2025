 Industry Background 
 Network Traffic Growth and Increased Capacity Requirements 
 6 

Table of Contents 

 The markets into which we sell are dynamic and characterized by a high rate of change. Optical networks which carry video, data, and voice traffic by encoding digital information on multiple wavelengths of light traveling across fiber optic cables continue to experience strong demand for increased bandwidth due to traffic growth. This network traffic growth is being driven by a diverse set of communications services that often require on-demand service levels by enterprise and consumer end users, as well as cloud-based and AI services and applications: 
 Cloud-Based Services. Enterprises and consumers continue to replace locally-housed computing and storage by adopting a broad array of innovative cloud-based models including Platform as a Service (PaaS), Software as a Service SaaS and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and an expanding range of cloud-based services that host key applications, store data, enable the viewing and downloading of content, and utilize on-demand computing resources. In addition, content is increasingly moving to the network edge, creating capacity and traffic demands closer to the user. 
 
 Generative AI Gen-AI ). In recent periods, Gen-AI platforms have experienced rapid and unprecedented user adoption with a notable array of new offerings entering the market across a diverse set of use cases. Gen-AI presents significant opportunities for businesses and other users to automate tasks, augment creativity, and improve operational efficiency. Given the Gen-AI adoption trajectory to date, and its potential to be a significant contributor to innovation and productivity, Gen-AI has been and will likely continue in future periods to be a significant stimulant or accelerator of network demand, both inside and outside of the data center. 
 Over-the-Top OTT Services and Video Streaming . OTT content refers to video, multimedia and other applications provided directly from the content source to the viewer or end user across a third-party network. Traffic from streaming and OTT services, including high definition and ultra-high definition video, has expanded with the increased availability of, and end-user demand for, video content accessible through a variety of devices and media. 
 Mobile Traffic and Fifth-Generation Wireless Broadband 5G ). Traffic from mobile web applications, including video, internet, and data services, has expanded with the continued proliferation of smartphones and other wireless devices. Because much of wireless traffic ultimately travels across a wireline network to reach its destination, growth in mobile communications continues to place higher demands upon wireline networks, including the backhaul and fronthaul portions of networks emanating from cell sites. 5G technology is further enabling meaningful increases in bandwidth and performance and enabling emerging applications and services that 4G/LTE networks cannot support. To fully capitalize on these opportunities, network operators will need to consider the demands that 5G technology will place on their wireline infrastructures. 
 Machine Learning ML and AI. By enhancing network intelligence and automation, ML and AI can enable improvements in network planning, operations, user experience and trouble resolution. Adoption of these technologies is expected to continue to increase as the IoT expands and additional services are created, and ML and AI are expected to continue to serve as drivers of further network traffic and solutions innovation, including driving bandwidth demands in various industries, including manufacturing, research and development, robotics, security, healthcare, and transportation. 
 Fiber-Based Access Networks - Residential and Enterprise . In recent years there has been a shift in bandwidth demands, traffic patterns, and computing functions to the edge of networks, including due to increases in remote and hybrid working and distance learning. With a higher percentage of data flows concentrating closer to the network edge, more capacity and higher bandwidth to home and enterprise locations are required. Network densification initiatives by cable and multiservice operators seek to push more digital fiber closer to the end user in an effort to increase potential bandwidth, computing capability and data speeds to homes and enterprises, while decreasing power, space, and operating costs. Wireline service providers are responding to similar service and end customer demands by extending fiber to the home and deeper into access networks. In addition, a growing number of governments around the world are investing in rolling out access networks to underserved communities as part of an effort to bridge the digital divide. 
 Emerging technologies, services, and applications are further impacting, or are expected to impact, network infrastructures, particularly at the edge of networks, where increased computing power and automation are required to meet the quality of experience required by end users. Examples of these include: 
 Internet of Things IoT . As networked connections between devices and servers grow, machine-to-machine-related traffic M2M is expected to represent an increasing portion of traffic. These connections allow sharing of data that can be monitored and analyzed, including in smart grid applications, health care and safety monitoring, resource and 
 7 

Table of Contents 

 inventory management, home entertainment, consumer appliances, connected transportation and other M2M data applications. 
 Immersive Technologies and Ultra-High Definition Video UHD ). Immersive technologies like virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), interactive experiences, gaming, and 360 video, as well as UHD (4K and 8K) video, are placing or likely to place further capacity demands on networks as adoption of these technologies grows. Consumer electronics and other technology companies are rapidly advancing these applications, which require high bandwidth and low latency, and are making the associated devices more widely available and affordable to consumers. 
 Edge Computing . To provide end users with the required experience for a growing set of immersive cloud services, network operators have increased, and are expected to continue to increase, the number and capabilities of edge computing locations to allow these latency-sensitive workloads to be processed closer to users. These changes at the edge of networks may affect network topologies, demands, and traffic patterns. 
 We believe that increased adoption of these technologies, services, and applications and their performance requirements will further increase network traffic and place additional service challenges on network infrastructures. We also believe that, in turn, network operators will be required to invest in their metro, access, and aggregation networks, as well as their core networks. 
 Demand for Network Transformation 
 In the face of intense competition and disruptive business models, communications service providers globally are engaging in large network transformation efforts that aim to simplify and reduce operational costs and create agile, software-driven platforms from which to develop new revenue-generating services. As part of these efforts, providers are reimagining legacy processes and software in their business support systems BSS and operations support systems OSS and redefining how they want these software platforms to interact with network infrastructure. The goal of these initiatives is to enhance customer loyalty, create a more digital experience for their end users, reduce operational complexity and costs, and introduce greater service agility. As a result, we expect that network operators will continue to pursue strategies that better leverage AI, automation, consulting services, analytics, and software control capabilities in an effort to achieve this transformation. 
 We expect that service providers will also pursue closed loop automation between their software operations platforms and network infrastructure. Closed loop automation is a continuous cycle of communications between the programmable network infrastructure and software control elements to analyze network conditions, traffic demands, and resource availability to determine the best placement of traffic or network functions to deliver optimal service quality and resource utilization. 
 We believe that adoption of these network transformation strategies around OSS and BSS, and the related evolution of core, metro, aggregation and access network infrastructures, will require network operators and their network solutions vendors increasingly to look to utilize an ecosystem of cloud-native software, consulting and delivery services, and software-optimized and controlled physical and virtual network resources. We expect that these network architectural approaches, in turn, will require an increased degree of cooperation, collaboration and interoperability among networking solutions vendors. 
 Different Approaches to Design and Procure Network Infrastructure Solutions 
 Network operators are pursuing a diverse range of approaches, or consumption models, in their design and procurement of network infrastructure solutions. In addition to purchasing fully integrated network solutions including hardware, software and services from the same vendor, new consumption models include the procurement or use of: 
 a fully integrated infrastructure solution from one vendor with the separate use of a network operator s own software or that of another vendor; 
 integrated photonic line systems with open interfaces from one vendor and the separate or disaggregated procurement of modem technology from a different vendor; 
 open source software in concert with or as an alternative to integrated, proprietary third-party software solutions; 
 open IP network operating systems running on off-the-shelf third-party equipment; and 
 system integration services or customer self-integration to reconstitute the disaggregated components. 
 Driven by the need to add capacity quickly and by restrictions in some jurisdictions on fiber ownership, some cloud providers are using managed optical fiber networks MOFN through which they lease lit fiber pairs from advanced optical networks owned by communications service providers in order to expand their reach and better serve their end users. In addition, some network operators are pursuing network strategies that emphasize the deployment of smaller form factor, 
 8 

Table of Contents 

 pluggable modem technology, that can be housed in a switch or router platform or used in place of a modem in a traditional optical system. 
 The consumption models that ultimately emerge and their level of adoption will depend in significant part on the circumstances and strategies of certain network operators. While the adoption of these approaches has been limited to date, we expect that continued customer consideration of a variety of consumption models will require network operators and vendors alike to assess, and possibly broaden, their offerings and commercial models over time. We expect this dynamic will place a premium on a vendor s ability to provide a range of network solutions with the maximum amount of flexibility and choice. 
 Supply Chain and Demand Environment Dynamics 
 In the face of demand across a range of industries, global supply for certain raw materials and components, including, in particular, semiconductor, integrated circuits, and other electronic components, experienced substantial constraint and disruption in recent prior periods. Though supply conditions have stabilized from their highest levels of disruption, they have yet to return to conditions experienced in the period prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. In response, governments and some of our network operator customers worldwide have intensified efforts to enhance supply chain resilience, emphasizing the need for robust risk management strategies. 
 
 During the most difficult periods of supply constraint, companies across many industries, including those of our end customers, deployed risk mitigation strategies to ensure continued operations. The strategies employed by some of our customers included increases in advance orders of networking equipment. With the stabilizing supply chain environment experienced in recent periods, customers strategies have shifted, resulting in their need to digest their excess inventory of networking equipment purchased during that period, which led to a period of lower demand for equipment. 
 
 The United States and various foreign governments have established certain trade and tariff requirements, and from time to time the U.S. government has indicated a willingness to revise, renegotiate, or terminate various existing multilateral trade agreements and to impose new taxes and restrictions on certain goods imported into the United States. Current dynamics between the United States and China are playing a pivotal role in shaping the global supply chain landscape, and have had an important impact on trade policies, resiliency efforts, and various domestic preference and investment initiatives. This changing bilateral relationship, which is marked by trade tensions and geopolitical complexities, has prompted both nations to reassess their economic strategies, creating a dynamic environment for many industries. This environment, characterized by tariffs and technological competition, may introduce reconfiguration of global supply chains and prompt companies to diversify sourcing and manufacturing locations. In addition, the incoming U.S. administration has announced an intent to impose additional tariffs, including on all imports from China, Mexico, and Canada. Simultaneously, there is a growing emphasis on domestic preference initiatives, as countries seek to bolster their own manufacturing capabilities in an effort to ensure greater economic autonomy. This evolving landscape presents challenges and opportunities for companies navigating the wide range of resulting regulatory, economic and supply chain management complexities. 
 
 Product Development and Sustainability 
 As network traffic and service expansion continue to grow, we believe network operators are seeking technology innovation to help support their business models in preparation for a low carbon future. Network operators are also increasingly looking to their technology vendors to help them manage the environmental impact of their networks, including energy use, greenhouse gas emissions, and waste. Market transition to a low carbon future and greener technology presents meaningful opportunities for enhanced competitive positioning and business growth for technology innovation leaders capable of advancing a product development strategy that addresses network performance and sustainability outcomes. 
 Strategy 
 Our strategy is to leverage our optical technology leadership to drive the profitable growth of our business and to expand our addressable market into complementary and adjacent network applications, in particular with respect to opportunities to apply coherent technologies inside and around the data center. The key pillars of our strategy are set forth below: 
 Expand Leadership in Optical Networking. We are focused on using our significant research and development investment capacity to push the pace of innovation in our traditional markets. We continue to innovate, increase the performance of, and enhance the capabilities for our leading WaveLogic TM coherent modem technology in multiple form factors. Specifically, we have brought to market the sixth generation of this technology in our WaveLogic6 Extreme performance-optimized form factor, and we intend to bring to market our WaveLogic6 Nano WL6n pluggable offering for users that prioritize power and space considerations. In addition, to capture opportunities to expand our market inside and around the data center, we intend to invest in photonic line systems and coherent pluggables for data center application.

Table of Contents 

 and the United States, to manufacture, support and ship our products, and therefore are exposed to risks associated with their businesses, financial condition and the geographies in which they operate, including political risk, changes in tax and trade policy involving such countries, including tariffs, and physical risk, including the impact of climate change. We also rely upon contract manufacturers and other third parties to perform design and prototype development, component procurement, full production, final assembly, testing, and distribution operations. Our manufacturers and component distribution partners procure components necessary for assembly and manufacture of our products based on our specifications, approved vendor lists, bills of materials and testing and quality standards. Our manufacturers and component distribution partners activity is based on rolling forecasts that we provide to them to estimate demand for our products. We work closely with these partners and our suppliers to manage material, quality, cost and delivery times, inventory levels, and we continually evaluate their services in an effort to ensure performance on a reliable and cost-effective basis. Generally, our agreements with our suppliers and contract manufacturers are frame agreements against which we place purchase orders and do not commit to long-term volume purchases. 
 We currently use partners and, in some cases, the same partners that support our manufacturing, to fulfill and deliver our products to customers. We believe that our sourcing, manufacturing, and distribution strategies allow us to conserve capital, lower costs of product sales, adjust quickly to changes in market demand, and operate without dedicating significant resources to manufacturing-related plant and equipment. 
 We continue to focus on a range of initiatives that seek to optimize our operations, improve our resiliency, and drive cost reductions and efficiencies. Our efforts include process optimization initiatives, such as vendor-managed inventory, and other operational models and strategies designed to drive improved efficiencies in our sourcing, production, logistics, and fulfillment. To enhance operational efficiency and modernize our supply chain operations, while driving long-term sustainability and resilience in the face of dynamic market conditions, we are pursuing a number of digital technology transformation efforts, including advanced analytics, automation, and other digital supply chain management solutions. We regularly assess and monitor our supply chain risks and have implemented various strategies to mitigate these risks and enhance resilience. These measures include dual-sourcing strategies, inventory management initiatives, multi-geography operational capabilities, and ongoing direct relationships with key suppliers to ensure transparency and alignment with our goals. 
 We actively work with our third-party vendors and business partners to promote socially responsible business practices within our global supply chain. To that end, we have adopted the principles set forth in the Responsible Business Alliance RBA Code of Conduct. The RBA Code of Conduct establishes standards that aim to ensure that working conditions in the electronics industry, or industries in which electronics are a key component, and in their supply chains are safe, that workers are treated with respect and dignity, and that business operations are environmentally responsible and conducted ethically. We promote these principles and require our suppliers to agree to adhere to these same standards. We also publish a Sustainability Report and maintain a Human Rights Policy applicable to suppliers, each of which includes more detail about our efforts to promote responsible business practices. 
 Seasonality 
 We have historically experienced seasonal quarterly fluctuations in customer activity in both orders and revenue, particularly with service provider customers. We have experienced reductions in order volume toward the end of the calendar year, as the procurement cycles of these customers slow and network deployment activity is curtailed. This period coincides with the first quarter of our fiscal year. This seasonality in our order flows has typically caused revenue for the first quarter of our fiscal year to be below that of the preceding quarter. These seasonal effects may not apply consistently in future periods and may not be a reliable indicator of our future revenue or results of operations. The effects of the dynamic demand environment we have experienced in recent periods, together with our backlog, have impacted and may continue to impact the traditional seasonality in our business. In addition, the growth as a percentage of our revenue of cloud provider customers, who do not necessarily follow the same seasonal ordering pattern, may also change this pattern in the future. For a more detailed discussion of the current demand environment and our backlog, see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview in Item 7 of Part II of this annual report. 
 Competition 
 Competition among networking solution vendors remains intense on a global basis. The market in which we compete is characterized by rapidly advancing technology, frequent introduction of new solutions, and aggressive selling efforts, including using significant pricing pressure to displace incumbent vendors and capture market share. Competition for sales of networking solutions, including our Networking Platforms and Platform Software and Services, is dominated by a small number of very large, multi-national companies. Our competitors include Nokia, Huawei (as defined below), Cisco, Juniper Networks, and ZTE. As compared to us, many of these competitors have substantially greater financial, operational and marketing resources, significantly broader product offerings, and more established relationships with customers. Because of their scale and resources, 
 16 

Table of Contents 

 they may be perceived to be a better fit for the procurement or network strategies of larger network operators. We also continue to compete with several smaller but established companies that offer one or more products that compete directly or indirectly with our offerings or whose products address specific niches within the markets and customer segments we address. These competitors include Infinera, Ribbon Communications, Marvell Technology Group, and Adtran. We also compete with a number of companies that provide significant competition for a specific product, application, service, customer segment, or geographic market. 
 
 We also expect the competition in our industry to continue to broaden and to intensify as network operators pursue a diverse range of network strategies and consumption models. As these changes occur, we expect that our business will overlap more directly with additional networking solution suppliers, including IP router vendors, data center switch providers, and other suppliers or integrators of networking technology traditionally geared toward different network applications, layers or functions. We may also face competition from system and component vendors, including those in our supply chain, who develop pluggable modem technology or other networking products based on off-the-shelf or commoditized hardware technology, particularly where a customer s network strategy seeks to emphasize deployment of such product offerings or the adoption of a disaggregated approach to the procurement of hardware and software. As we promote our corporate strategy and seek increased customer adoption of our Blue Planet Automation Software, we expect to compete more directly with software vendors and traditional IT services vendors. Competitors for our Blue Planet Automation Software include Cisco, Nokia, Amdocs, ServiceNow, Netcracker, and Ericsson. 
 Across our markets and segments, the principal competitive factors can include, among others: 
 functionality, speed, capacity, scalability and performance of network solutions; 
 the ability to meet business needs and drive successful outcomes, including meeting customer delivery time requirements; 
 price for performance, cost per bit and total cost of ownership of network solutions; 
 incumbency and strength of existing business relationships; 
 technology roadmap, time-to-market in delivering products and features, and forward innovation capacity; 
 company stability and financial health; 
 ability to offer solutions that accommodate a range of different consumption models; 
 operating costs and total cost of ownership; 
 services and support capabilities; 
 product security capabilities; and 
 ability to help customers achieve their sustainability goals. 
 
 Our competitive landscape has been and is likely to continue to be impacted by international trade and related matters, in particular between the U.S. and China. For example, in 2019, the U.S. Department of Commerce amended the U.S. Export Administration Regulations EAR by adding Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. Huawei and certain affiliates to the Entity List for actions contrary to the national security and foreign policy interests of the U.S., resulting in significant new restrictions on the export, reexport and transfer of U.S. regulated technologies and products to Huawei. In 2020, the U.S. Department of Commerce added additional Huawei affiliates to the Entity List, confirmed the expiration of a temporary general license applicable to Huawei, and amended the foreign direct product rule under the EAR in a manner that significantly expanded its application to Huawei. Separately, the U.S. government has taken steps to restrict federal agencies from doing business with, and U.S. wireless carriers from using federal subsidies to buy equipment from, Huawei and ZTE. The U.S. government has also encouraged other governments to consider similar restrictions. These actions, among others, have resulted in escalating tensions between the U.S. and China and retaliation by China, including a recent prohibition on export of certain rare minerals, and introduce a risk that the Chinese government may take further steps to retaliate against U.S. industries or companies. Trade regulations limiting or banning sales into, or purchases from, certain countries or companies have also impacted and may in the future impact our ability to transact business in certain countries and with certain customers. In addition, the incoming U.S. administration has announced an intent to impose additional tariffs, including tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China. 
 Patents, Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property Rights 
 The success of our business and technology leadership depends significantly on our proprietary and internally developed technology. We rely upon the intellectual property protections afforded by patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secret laws to establish, maintain, and enforce rights in our proprietary technologies and product branding. We regularly file applications for patents, and we have a significant number of patents in the United States and other countries in which we do business. As of December 2, 2024, we had approximately 2,300 issued patents and more than 700 pending patent applications worldwide. 
 17 

Table of Contents 

 Enforcing proprietary rights, especially patents, can be costly, and we cannot be certain that the steps that we are taking will detect, prevent, or minimize the risks of all unauthorized use. The industry in which we compete is characterized by rapidly changing technology, a large number of patents, and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. We have been subject to several claims related to patent infringement, and we have been requested to indemnify customers pursuant to contractual indemnity obligations relating to infringement claims made by third parties. Intellectual property infringement assertions could cause us to incur substantial costs, including settlement costs and legal fees in the defense of related actions. If we are not successful in defending these claims, our business could be adversely affected. 
 Our operating system software, Platform Software, Blue Planet Automation Software, and other solutions incorporate software and components under licenses from third parties, including software subject to various open source software licenses. Failure to obtain or maintain such licenses or other third-party intellectual property rights could affect our development efforts and market opportunities or could require us to re-engineer our products or to obtain alternate technologies. Moreover, there is a risk that open source and other technology licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products. 
 Environment and Sustainability 
 Our environmental goals have been approved by the Science Based Target initiative and that align our decarbonization efforts with the Paris Climate Agreement goal to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Our environmental strategy centers on continuing to innovate our products and services to help reduce the power, space, and materials required to operate them, engaging our suppliers and driving operational efficiencies to reduce our environmental impact, and promoting an employee experience that engages our workforce on sustainability. 
 Our products and product development efforts pursue power and space improvements aimed to create more efficient and sustainable networks for our customers and enabling their climate ambitions. We promote environmental sustainability through our efforts to improve the energy efficiency per gigabit of throughput in our networking solutions, as well as our initiatives to reduce the total number of network elements required to operate a network. We pursue opportunities to minimize the resource impacts in our product design, and to manage the life cycle impact of our products, including packaging and distribution, support, and end-of-life reuse, refurbishment, and recycling. We voluntarily submit CDP climate change and water disclosures and Ecovadis sustainability disclosures annually, and we are a member of the RBA. We seek to ensure that our key direct suppliers adopt the standards and principles set forth in the RBA Code of Conduct. 
 People and Culture 
 Our technology solutions are developed, marketed, sold and supported by our global workforce of 8,657 employees as of November 2, 2024, over 99 of whom were full-time employees. We have a broad base of talent in 39 countries, with approximately 56 in the Americas, 36 in APAC, and 8 in EMEA, the majority of whom are in engineering, operations, or sales roles. 
 We believe that our industry and innovation leadership is ultimately rooted in people. Competition for qualified personnel in the technology space is intense, and our success depends in large part on our ability to recruit, develop and retain a productive and engaged workforce. Accordingly, investing in our employees and their well-being, offering competitive compensation and benefits, and adopting progressive human capital management practices constitute a core element of our corporate strategy. 
 Our Board of Directors oversees our corporate strategy, which includes management s design and execution of our people strategy. This strategy seeks to ensure that we continue to attract and retain the talent necessary to execute on our business plans, and that we have programs, initiatives, rewards and recognition that are well aligned and support these goals. Through our People Promise, we promote a workplace environment where our employees are empowered, feel included, and have an opportunity to make a difference through their work at Ciena. In doing so, we seek to cultivate for employees a culture of belonging and happiness, enabling us to be an attractive employer of choice within our markets. Our executive team is actively involved in and sponsors key initiatives and employee resource groups intended to promote this corporate culture. To that end, our people strategy is focused on the following: 
 Promote a Diverse, Inclusive, and Equitable Culture. We believe inclusivity and diversity contribute to business success. We promote an inclusive and diverse workplace, where all individuals are respected and feel they belong regardless of their age, race, national origin, gender, religion, disability, sexual orientation or gender identity. We do this through recruiting outreach, internal networking and resource groups, inclusivity networks, and mentoring programs. We regularly monitor our recruitment process in consideration of the diversity of our workforce and candidate pool and continue to offer Conscious Inclusion workshops to deepen understanding within our diverse

 groups. In addition, we support multiple active internal networking and resource groups, including our Women at Ciena group, Black African Heritage at Ciena group, LatinX at Ciena group, Asian at Ciena group, Pride at Ciena group, Vets at Ciena group, and Next at Ciena early in career group. In fiscal 2023, we continued to run a targeted development program aimed at strengthening underrepresented individuals sense of belonging and enhancing communication, confidence, self-awareness and financial acumen. 
 Support Employee Wellbeing and Engagement. We prioritize supporting the overall wellbeing of our employees and their eligible dependents. We provide a broad and diverse suite of programs that focus on physical, mental and emotional, financial and social wellbeing, and have expanded our offerings to include a focus on key life events such as aging and retirement readiness. Our wellbeing programs are deployed through a variety of means, including expense reimbursement benefits, wellbeing challenges and rewards, 24x7 crisis support, employee assistance resources, mental health coaching, and a library of resources accessible to participants digitally and through hosted webinars. We regularly seek input from employees through employee engagement and pulse surveys on specific issues that are intended to assess our degree of success in promoting an environment that supports our People Promise and measures our culture of compliance. Our fiscal 2024 employee engagement survey had a participation rate of approximately 84 and resulted in an engagement score that exceeded industry benchmarks. Our global wellbeing program also includes a long-standing practice of remote and flexible working arrangements and flexible paid time off in many of our geographies, which allows us to broaden our potential talent pool for employees. 
 Offer Competitive Compensation and Ensure Pay Equity. We strive to ensure that our employees receive competitive, fair and transparent compensation, and progressive benefits offerings. We conduct an annual pay equity assessment of gender globally and of ethnicity in the U.S. and take action to ensure that we are paying individuals performing similar work equitably. We deploy Syndio s workplace equity platform to fine-tune our methodology and enable regular global pay equity assessments. To align performance and stockholder interest, we base our annual incentive compensation on both business and individual performance. We maintain an employee stock purchase plan, and in recent years we have broadly expanded employee participation in equity compensation, particularly within technology roles in engineering and sales, and have increased the percentage of employees receiving equity awards from approximately 21 in fiscal 2020 to approximately 50 in fiscal 2024. We also offer comprehensive family leave, including global family leave to support employees throughout various life stages, carer s leave, bereavement leave, parental leave that includes a minimum of 18 weeks paid time off for new mothers (including eight weeks recovery and ten weeks bonding) and ten weeks paid time off for new fathers and adoptive parents, and financial assistance for adoptive parents, and offer flexible paid time-off to more than 98 of our workforce globally. We offer meaningful retirement benefits, including a recently introduced post-retirement equity vesting benefit for long-tenured employees, and programs to promote retirement readiness among our employees. In recent years, we have enhanced employer contributions to our North America retirement plans, added our first ESG fund option for employees and, as of November 2, 2024, achieved greater than 99 participation of eligible employees in the U.S. and Canada in our defined contribution retirement plans. 
 Provide Programs for Employee Recognition. We also offer rewards and recognition programs to our employees, including peer and management-initiated awards to recognize employees who achieve noteworthy accomplishments and who best exemplify our core values, as well as patent incentive and distinguished engineer awards. We believe that providing these recognition programs helps drive strong employee performance. 
 Create Opportunities for Growth and Development. We focus on creating opportunities for employee growth, development, training, and education at all career stages. We provide opportunities to cultivate talent and identify candidates for new roles from within the Company and deliver early in career and new graduate networking and development programs, management and leadership development programs, coaching and mentoring programs, and support for continuing education through tuition reimbursement. We operate a leadership succession planning process that aims to develop and retain key talent and ensure business continuity for key roles. We also recently launched a program to identify individuals throughout the organization who have been identified as having high potential for future growth and development, so that this earlier in career talent can be nurtured for future leadership roles. 
 Promote Community Outreach and Support. We believe it is important to give back and promote community outreach and support through corporate giving, charitable matching, and employee volunteerism in the communities in which we live and work. Through our Ciena Cares community program, we provide corporate matching of employee charitable donations, flexible volunteering during work time, and corporate rewards for service hours that can be donated by employees to their charity of choice. Our Digital Inclusion initiative aims to mobilize our global workforce, leverage our innovation leadership, and collaborate with customers, suppliers and other partners to help bridge the 
 19 

Table of Contents 

 digital divide. Through this initiative, we have funded programs to support underserved students in communities across the globe by providing greater connectivity, access to enabling technologies and digital skills development. 
 Promote a Strong Ethical Business Culture. We believe that commitments to good corporate governance and the highest ethical standards are essential to our long-term success, and we are dedicated to instilling in our employees a commitment to integrity and business ethics. We maintain a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that sets standards of conduct for Ciena s directors, officers and employees. All employees are required to complete training on our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, and we conduct recurring employee affirmations with respect to our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and periodic training and communication related to specific topics contained therein. In addition, we maintain a Corporate Compliance Committee that promotes integrity and compliance leadership throughout Ciena, and a dedicated function focused exclusively on Compliance and Ethics. We also maintain several easily accessible internal and external methods by which our employees, business partners, and investors can report concerns relating to the ethical operation of our business, including anonymously where permitted. We conduct surveys of all employees on our compliance program and culture of integrity in order to assess and strengthen our culture and practices, and received feedback from approximately 68 of our employees on these surveys in fiscal 2024. 
 Governmental Regulations 
 Environmental Matters 
 Environmental regulation is increasing across various jurisdictions, and we expect that our domestic and international operations may be subject to additional environmental compliance requirements, which could require us to incur additional costs. To date, our compliance actions and costs relating to environmental regulations have not resulted in a material cost or effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. Our business and operations are currently subject to environmental laws in various jurisdictions around the world, including the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment WEEE and Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment RoHS regulations adopted by the EU. We are also subject to disclosure and related requirements that apply to the presence of conflict minerals in our products or supply chain. We seek to operate our business in compliance with applicable laws relating to the materials and content of our products and product takeback and recycling, and have programs, policies, and customer offerings that help us to address these laws. 
 Other Regulations 
 As a company with global operations, we are subject to complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, including trade regulations, tariffs, import and export regulations, anti-bribery and corruption laws, antitrust or competition laws, data privacy laws and regulations, such as the European Union EU General Data Protection Regulation (the GDPR ), cybersecurity laws and regulations, and environmental regulations, among others. We have policies and procedures in place to promote compliance with these laws and regulations. To date, our compliance actions and costs relating to these laws, rules and regulations have not resulted in a material cost or effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. Government regulations are subject to change and, accordingly, we are unable to assess the possible effect of compliance with future requirements or whether our compliance with such regulations will materially impact our business in the future. For further discussion of how government regulations may affect our business, see the related discussion in Risk Factors Risks Related to Intellectual Property, Litigation, Regulation and Government Policy.

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 Investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk. In addition to the other information contained in this annual report, you should consider the following risk factors before investing in our securities. 
 Risks Related to Our Business and Industry 
 Our revenue, gross margin, and operating results can fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and, if we are not able to secure order growth, our revenue may not reach the levels we anticipate. 
 Our revenue, gross margin, and results of operations can fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter. Our budgeted expense levels are based on our intent to invest to maintain or increase our technology advantage, our visibility into customer spending plans, and our projections of future revenue and gross margin. Visibility into customer spending levels can be uncertain, spending patterns are subject to change, and reductions in our expense levels can take significant time to implement. Historically, a significant portion of our quarterly revenue was generated from customer orders received during that same quarter (which we refer to as book to revenue and was therefore less predictable and subject to fluctuation due to a quarterly shortfall in orders from expectations. During fiscal 2022, however, we generated a significant backlog of customer orders as a result of supply chain constraints and, during fiscal 2023, our revenue grew as we consumed a significant portion of this backlog. Customer order volumes began to moderate in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, and we experienced order levels below revenue during fiscal 2023 and the first half of fiscal 2024 and, as a result, our backlog decreased. We expect our backlog to continue to reduce in fiscal 2025. As that happens, we expect our reliance upon securing quarterly book to revenue orders to grow and those orders to represent a more typical composition of our quarterly revenue over time. Our future revenue growth will depend, in part, on securing increased orders, particularly book to revenue orders. 
 
 Within these dynamics, our results for a particular period can be difficult to predict and a range of factors, including those set forth below, can materially adversely affect quarterly revenue, gross margin, and operating results: 
 
 changes in spending levels or network deployment plans by customers, particularly with respect to our service provider and cloud provider customers; 
 order timing and volume, including book to revenue orders; 
 the timing of revenue recognition on sales, particularly relating to large orders; 
 availability of components and manufacturing capacity; 
 shipment and delivery timing, including any deferral of delivery; 
 backlog levels; 
 the level of competition and pricing pressure in our industry; 
 the pace and impact of price erosion that we regularly encounter in our markets; 
 the impact of commercial concessions or unfavorable commercial terms required to maintain incumbency or secure new opportunities with key customers; 
 the mix of revenue by product segment, geography, and customer in any particular quarter; 
 our level of success in achieving targeted cost reductions and improved efficiencies in our supply chain; 
 our incurrence of start-up costs, including lower margin phases of projects required to support initial deployments, to gain new customers, or to enter new markets; 
 our level of success in accessing new markets and obtaining new customers; 
 long- and short-term changing behaviors or customer needs that impact demand for our products and services, or the products and services of our customers; 
 technology-based price compression and our introduction of new platforms with improved price for performance; 
 changing market, economic, and political conditions, including the impact of tariffs and other trade restrictions or efforts to withdraw from or materially modify international trade agreements; 
 factors beyond our control such as natural disasters, climate change, acts of war or terrorism, and public health emergencies, such as epidemics and pandemics like the COVID-19 pandemic; 
 the financial stability of our customers and suppliers; 
 consolidation activity among our customers, suppliers, and competitors; 
 installation service availability and readiness of customer sites; 
 adverse impact of foreign exchange; and 
 any potential seasonal effects in our business. 
 
 As a result of these factors and other conditions affecting our business and operating results, we believe that quarterly comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily a good indication of future performance. Quarterly fluctuations from the above and other factors may cause our revenue, gross margin, and results of operations to underperform in relation to our 
 23 

Table of Contents 

 guidance, long-term financial targets or the expectations of financial analysts or investors, which may cause volatility or decreases in our stock price. 
 
 A small number of customers account for a significant portion of our revenue. The loss of one or more of these customers, or a significant reduction in their spending, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 
 A significant portion of our revenue is concentrated among a small number of communications service provider and cloud provider customers. For example, our ten largest customers contributed 57.9 of our revenue for fiscal 2024 and 53.7 of our revenue for fiscal 2023. A cloud provider customer accounted for approximately 13.3 of our total revenue for fiscal 2024 and 12.8 of our total revenue for fiscal 2023, and AT T accounted for approximately 11.8 of our total revenue for fiscal 2024 and 10.6 of our total revenue for fiscal 2023. As a result of efforts in recent years to diversify our business, the customer segments and geographies that comprise our customer base and top customers by revenue have changed. During fiscal 2024, four cloud providers were among our top ten customers. Cloud provider customers have been important contributors to our revenue through both our direct sales to them, including for data center interconnection, and their indirect impact on purchases by other network operators. 
 Because of our concentration of revenue with communications service providers and cloud providers, our business and results of operations can be significantly affected by market, industry, regulatory, consolidation or competitive dynamics adversely affecting these customer segments. These dynamics have in the past had an adverse effect on network spending levels by certain of our largest customers and they could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. Consequently, our financial results and our ability to grow our business are closely correlated with the spending of a relatively small number of customers. Our business and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted by the loss of a large customer within or outside of these customer segments as well as by reductions in spending or capital expenditure budgets, changes in network deployment plans, or changes in consumption models for acquiring networking solutions by our largest customers. 
 We face intense competition that could impact our sales and results of operations. We expect our competitive landscape to continue to broaden as we seek to expand our addressable market and solutions portfolio. 
 We face intense global competition on a global basis, as we and our competitors aggressively seek to capture market share and displace incumbent equipment vendors. Our industry has historically been dominated by a small number of very large vendors, some of which have substantially greater financial, marketing and research and development resources, broader product offerings and more established relationships with service providers and other customer segments than we do. Moreover, acquisition activity among our competitors and peers has increased. For example, in 2024 Nokia announced its proposed acquisition of Infinera. Consolidation in our industry may result in competitors with greater resources, pricing flexibility, or other competitive benefits. We also compete with a number of smaller companies that provide significant competition for specific products, applications, customer segments or geographic markets. Due to the narrower focus of their efforts, these competitors may be more attractive to customers in a particular product niche or commercial opportunity. 
 Generally, competition in our markets is based on any one or a combination of the following factors: 
 functionality, speed, capacity, scalability and performance of network solutions; 
 the ability to meet business needs and drive successful outcomes, including meeting customer delivery time requirements; 
 price for performance, cost per bit and total cost of ownership of network solutions; 
 incumbency and strength of existing business relationships; 
 technology roadmap and forward innovation capacity, including the ability to invest significant sums in research and development; 
 time-to-market in delivering products and features; 
 company stability and financial health; 
 ability to offer comprehensive networking solutions, consisting of hardware, software and services; 
 flexibility and openness of platforms, including ease of integration, interoperability and integrated management; 
 ability to offer solutions that accommodate a range of different consumption models; 
 operating costs and total cost of ownership; 
 software and network automation capabilities; 
 ability to manage challenging supply chain environments, including manufacturing and lead-time capability; 
 services and support capabilities; 
 security of enterprise, product development, support processes, and products; 
 space requirements and power consumption of network solutions; and 
 24 

Table of Contents 

 ability to offer solutions that help customers manage the lifecycle impacts of their networks and achieve their sustainability goals. 
 
 We expect the competition in our industry to continue to broaden and to intensify, particularly as we seek to expand our addressable market opportunities, and as network operators pursue a diverse range of network strategies, sourcing practices and consumption models. An increase in the breadth or intensity of competition we face may adversely impact our business and results of operations. 
 Our failure to invest in the right technologies or to get an adequate return on such research and development investment could adversely affect our revenue and profitability. 
 The market for communications networking hardware and software solutions is characterized by rapidly evolving technologies, changes in market demand and increasing adoption of software-based networking solutions. We continually invest in research and development to sustain or enhance our solutions and to develop or acquire new technologies. There is often a lengthy period between commencing these development initiatives and bringing solutions to market. Accordingly, there is no guarantee that our new products or product enhancements will achieve market acceptance or that the timing of market adoption will be as predicted. As a general matter, there is a significant possibility that some of our development decisions, including significant expenditures on acquisitions, research and development, or investments in technologies, will not meet our expectations, and that our investment in some projects will be unprofitable. There is also a possibility that we may miss a market opportunity because we failed to invest or invested too late in a technology, product or enhancement sought by our customers or the markets into which we sell. Changes in market demand or investment priorities may also cause us to discontinue development for new products or features, which can have a disruptive effect on our relationships with customers. In addition, failure to develop new, innovative solutions that are attractive to customers and profitable to us could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
 We have no guaranteed purchases and regularly must re-win business with existing customers. 
 
 Generally, our customer contracts do not require customers to purchase any minimum or guaranteed volumes, and we conduct sales through framework contracts under which customers place purchase orders for which they often have the right to modify or cancel. We must regularly compete for and win business with existing customers across all of our customer segments. In addition, cloud providers tend to operate on shorter procurement cycles than some of our traditional customers, which can require us to compete to re-win business with these customers more frequently than required with other customers segments. Accordingly, there is no assurance that we will maintain our incumbency with any given customer or that our revenue levels from a customer in a particular period can be achieved in future periods. Customer spending levels can be unpredictable, and our sales to any customer could significantly decrease or cease at any time. 
 
 Network equipment sales often involve lengthy sales cycles and protracted contract negotiations that may require us to agree to commercial terms or conditions that negatively affect pricing, risk allocation, payment and the timing of revenue recognition. 
 
 Our sales efforts, particularly with communications service providers, cloud providers and other large customers, often involve lengthy sales cycles. These selling efforts often involve a significant commitment of time and resources that may include extensive product testing, laboratory or network certification, network or region-specific product certification and homologation requirements for deployment in networks. Even after a customer awards its business to us or decides to purchase our solutions, the length of time before deployment can vary depending on the customer s schedule, site readiness, the size of the network deployment, the degree of custom configuration required and other factors. Additionally, these sales also often involve protracted and sometimes difficult contract negotiations in which we may deem it necessary to agree to unfavorable contractual or commercial terms that adversely affect pricing, expose us to penalties for delays or non-performance, and require us to assume a disproportionate amount of risk. To maintain incumbency with key customers, we have in the past and may in the future be required to offer discounted pricing, make commercial concessions or offer less favorable terms as compared to our historical business arrangements with these customers. We may also be requested to provide deferred payment terms, vendor or third-party financing or other alternative purchase structures that extend the timing of payment. Alternatively, customers may insist on terms and conditions that we deem too onerous or not in our best interest, and we may be unable to reach a commercial agreement. As a result, we may incur substantial expense and devote time and resources to potential sales opportunities that never materialize or result in lower than anticipated sales and gross margin.

 Accurately matching necessary inventory levels to customer demand within the current environment is challenging, and we may incur additional costs or be required to write off significant inventory that would adversely impact our results of operations. 
 From the second quarter of fiscal 2021 through the third quarter of fiscal 2022, we received unprecedented orders for our products and services, during a period when the supply environment was constrained. We took a number of steps to mitigate these challenges, including extending our purchase commitments and placing non-cancellable, advanced orders with or through suppliers, particularly for long lead-time components. As of November 2, 2024, we had 1.7 billion in outstanding purchase order commitments to our contract manufacturers and component suppliers for inventory. We also expanded our manufacturing capacity and accumulated available raw materials inventory to prepare us to be able to produce finished goods more quickly as supply constraints eased for those components in shorter supply. As a result of this strategy, our inventory increased from 374.3 million at the end of fiscal 2021 to 1.1 billion at the end of fiscal 2023. While our inventory reduced to 820.4 million at the end of fiscal 2024, these inventory practices and their associated costs have had, and could in the future continue to have, an adverse impact on our cash from operations. 
 
 These inventory practices, particularly when considered in the context of our backlog, further introduce obsolescence risk that can impact our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, during fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024, certain customers, including communications service providers and cable and multiservice operators in North America, that had earlier placed significant advanced orders, rescheduled deliveries for or cancelled a portion of such orders. Accordingly, our inventory needs for a particular period can fluctuate and be difficult to predict. If our customers were to cancel or delay orders for extended periods, inventory could become obsolete, and we could be required to write off or write down the inventory associated with those orders. In addition, if customers were to cancel or delay existing or forecasted orders for which we have significant outstanding commitments to our contract manufacturers or suppliers, we may be required to purchase inventory under these commitments that we are unable to sell. If we are required to write off or write down a significant amount of inventory, our results of operations for the applicable period would be materially adversely affected. For example, we recorded charges for excess and obsolete inventory of 77.3 million, 29.5 million and 16.2 million in fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, primarily related to a decrease in the forecasted demand for certain Networking Platforms products primarily sold to communications service providers. Our inability to effectively manage the matching of inventory with customer demand, particularly within any supply constrained environment, could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition, and could result in loss of revenue, increased costs, or delays that could adversely impact customer satisfaction. 
 If we are unable to adapt our business and solutions offerings to the evolving consumption models of our customers, our competitive position and results of operations could be adversely affected. 
 Growing bandwidth demands and network operator efforts to reduce costs are resulting in a diverse range of approaches to the design and procurement of network infrastructure. We refer to these different approaches as consumption models. These consumption models can include: the traditional systems procurement of fully integrated solutions including acquiring hardware, software and services from the same vendor; the procurement of a fully integrated hardware solution from one vendor with the separate use of a network operator s own software-denied network-based controller; the procurement of an integrated photonic line system with open interfaces from one vendor and the separate or disaggregated procurement of modem technology from a different vendor; or the development and use of published reference designs and open source specifications for the procurement of white box hardware to be used with open source software. In parallel, network operators are also exploring procurement alternatives for software solutions, ranging from integrated and proprietary software platforms to fully open source software. Some network operators are pursuing the deployment of smaller form factor, pluggable modem technology, particularly within switching and routing solutions, as an alternative to integrated optical networking platforms. Other network operators, including certain of our cloud provider customers, are playing a leading role in the transition to software-defined networking, the standardization of communications network solutions and the assembly of their own hardware platforms based on enabling third-party components. We believe that the potential for different approaches to the procurement of networking infrastructure will require network operators and vendors to evolve and broaden their existing solutions and commercial models over time. If we are unable to adapt our business to these new consumption models and offer attractive solutions and commercial models that meet our customers needs, our competitive position and results of operations could be adversely affected. 
 As we introduce technologies that enable us to enter into new markets, we may experience difficulty monetizing these new solutions and be exposed to increased or new forms of competition. 
 
 A key part of our strategy is to expand our addressable market into complementary and adjacent network applications by investing in new technologies, including solutions related to data center, PON, routing and switching, and automation software and services. As we do so, we expect to compete more directly with a broader range of suppliers, including IP router vendors, component vendors, software vendors, and integrators of networking technology.We have a limited history in commercializing and selling these solutions and the market and competitive landscape for them is dynamic, and it is difficult to predict important 
 26 

Table of Contents 

 trends, including the potential growth, if any, of certain of these markets. If the markets relating to these solutions do not develop as we anticipate, or if we are unable to commercialize, increase market awareness of, or gain adoption of our solutions within those markets, revenue from these products may not grow, a key part of our strategy for growth would be adversely affected and our financial results may suffer. 
 
 Our go-to-market activities and the distribution of our WaveLogic coherent modem technology within the market for high-performance transceivers/modems could expose us to increased competition and poses other risks that could adversely affect our existing systems business or results of operations. 
 
 To expand our addressable market and address a range of customer consumption models, we recently entered the market for high-performance transceivers/modems. Making our critical coherent optical technology available in this manner could adversely impact the sale of products in our existing systems business. For example, our customers may choose to adopt disaggregated consumption models or third-party solutions that embed Ciena-designed optical modules instead of purchasing systems-based solutions directly from us. Accordingly, we may encounter situations where we are competing for opportunities in the market directly against a system from one of our competitors that incorporates Ciena-designed modules or other component technologies. Making this key technology available and enabling third-party sales of Ciena-designed modules may adversely affect our competitive position and increase the risk that third parties misappropriate or attempt to use our technology or related intellectual property without our authorization. These and other risks, unanticipated liabilities, or costs associated with the sales of our WaveLogic coherent technology could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business and our results of operations. 
 
 Supply chain challenges and constraints, including for semiconductor components, could adversely impact our growth, gross margins and financial results. 
 
 In the face of demand across a range of industries, global supply for certain raw materials and components, including, in particular, semiconductor, integrated circuits, and other electronic components used in most of our products, experienced substantial constraint and disruption in recent prior periods. As a result, we experienced significant component shortages, extended lead times, increased costs, and unexpected cancellation or delay of previously committed supply of key components across our supplier base. While reliability of supply has improved, extended lead times and elevated component costs could continue to adversely impact our revenue, our cost of goods sold, and our ability to reduce the cost to produce our products in a manner consistent with prior periods. It is unclear when the supply environment will fully stabilize, and there can be no assurance that we will not experience similar supply challenges or constraints in future periods. These challenges have affected, and could adversely affect, component availability, lead times and cost, which can adversely impact our revenue and have an impact on customer purchasing decisions. Supply chain challenges could also impact customer satisfaction or future business opportunities with customers, and result in increased use of cash, engineering design changes, and delays in new product introductions, each of which could adversely impact our business and financial results. 
 
 Our exposure to the credit risks of our customers and resellers may make it difficult to collect receivables and could adversely affect our revenue and operating results. 
 In the course of our sales to customers and resale channel partners, we may have difficulty collecting receivables, and our business and results of operations could be exposed to risks associated with uncollectible accounts. Lack of liquidity in the capital markets, macroeconomic weakness and market volatility may increase our exposure to these credit risks. Our attempts to monitor customer payment capability and to take appropriate measures to protect ourselves may not be sufficient, and it is possible that we may have to write down or write off accounts receivable. Such write-downs or write-offs could negatively affect our operating results for the period in which they occur, and, if large, could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and operating results. 
 We may be required to write down the value of certain significant assets, which would adversely affect our operating results. 
 We have a number of significant assets on our balance sheet as of November 2, 2024, the value of which can be adversely impacted by factors related to our business and operating performance, as well as factors outside of our control. As of November 2, 2024, our balance sheet includes a net deferred tax asset of 885.9 million. The value of our net deferred tax assets can be significantly impacted by changes in tax policy, changes in future tax rates, or by our tax planning strategy. If any write-downs are required, our operating results may be materially adversely affected. 
 
 As of November 2, 2024, our balance sheet also includes 444.7 million of goodwill. We test each reporting unit for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis and between annual tests, if an event occurs or circumstances change that would, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value. As of November 2, 2024, our balance sheet also includes 608.1 million in long-lived assets, which includes 165.0 million of intangible assets. Valuation of our long-lived assets requires us to make assumptions about future sales prices and sales volumes for our products. These assumptions are used to forecast future, undiscounted cash flows on which our estimates are based. If market conditions or our forecasts for our 
 27 

Table of Contents 

 business or any particular operating segment change, we may be required to reassess the value of these assets. We could be required to record an impairment charge against our goodwill and long-lived assets or a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. Any write-down of the value of these significant assets would have the effect of decreasing our earnings or increasing our losses in such period. If we are required to take a substantial write-down or charge, our operating results would be materially adversely affected in such period. 
 Problems affecting the performance, interoperability, reliability or security of our products could damage our business reputation and negatively affect our results of operations. 
 The development and production of sophisticated hardware and software for communications network equipment is highly complex. Some of our products can be fully tested only when deployed in communications networks or when carrying traffic, and software products may contain bugs that can interfere with expected performance. As a result, undetected defects or problems affecting quality, interoperability, reliability, security and performance are often more acute for initial deployments of new products or enhancements. We have recently launched, or are in the process of launching, a number of new hardware and software offerings, including new evolutions of our WaveLogic coherent optical modem technology and new Routing and Switching platforms. Unanticipated product performance problems can relate to the design, manufacturing, installation, operation and interoperability of our products. Undetected errors can also arise as a result of defects in third-party technologies, components or software, including open source software, or manufacturing, installation or maintenance services supplied by third parties. The introduction of new and complex technologies, such as AI, can also increase security risks and the risk of defects. From time to time, we have had to replace certain components, provide software remedies or other remediation in response to defects or bugs, and we may have to do so again in the future. Such remediation costs could materially adversely impact our business and results of operations. In addition, we have encountered and may continue to encounter unanticipated security vulnerabilities relating to our technology, including as a result of the activities of our supply chain and our use of third-party software. Communications technologies, given their capability to transmit sensitive information, have frequently been the target of attacks from a range of threat actors including nation states and other malicious parties. Any actual or perceived exposure of our solutions to vulnerabilities, malicious software or cyber-attacks, as well as any product performance, reliability, security and quality problems, may result in some or all of the following effects: 
 damage to our reputation, reduced demand, declining sales and order cancellations; 
 increased costs to remediate defects or replace products; 
 payment of liquidated damages, contractual or similar penalties, or other claims for performance failures or delays; 
 write-offs of inventory or property; 
 increased warranty expense or estimates resulting from higher failure rates, additional field service obligations or other rework costs related to defects; 
 regulatory enforcement penalties or settlements; 
 higher charges for increased inventory obsolescence; 
 disruption to the operation of our network operator customers; 
 reporting and other publication to customers or regulatory bodies; 
 costs, liabilities and claims that may not be covered by insurance coverage or recoverable from third parties; and 
 delays in introducing new products and services, recognizing revenue, or collecting accounts receivable. 
 These and other consequences could negatively affect our business and results of operations. 
 Strategic acquisitions and investments could disrupt our operations and may expose us to increased costs and unexpected liabilities. 
 From time to time, we acquire or make investments in other technology companies, or enter into other strategic relationships, to expand the markets we address, diversify our customer base or acquire, or accelerate the development of, technology or products. To do so, we may use cash, issue equity that could dilute our current stockholders, or incur debt or assume indebtedness. Strategic transactions can involve numerous additional risks, including: 
 failure to consummate or delay in consummating such transactions; 
 failure to achieve the anticipated transaction benefits or the projected financial results and operational synergies; 
 greater than expected acquisition and integration costs; 
 disruption due to the integration and rationalization of operations, products, technologies and personnel; 
 diversion of management attention; 
 difficulty completing projects of the acquired company and costs related to in-process projects; 
 difficulty managing customer transitions or entering into new markets; 
 the loss of key employees; 
 28 

Table of Contents 

 disruption or termination of business relationships with customers, suppliers, vendors, landlords, licensors and other business partners; 
 ineffective internal controls over financial reporting; 
 dependence on unfamiliar suppliers or manufacturers; 
 assumption of or exposure to unanticipated liabilities, including intellectual property infringement or other legal claims; and 
 adverse tax or accounting impact. 
 As a result of these and other risks, our acquisitions, investments or strategic transactions may not realize the intended benefits and may ultimately have a negative impact on our business, results of operation and financial condition. 
 Emerging issues related to the development and use of AI could give rise to legal or regulatory action, damage our reputation, or otherwise materially harm of our business . 
 Our development and use of AI technology in our products and operations remains in the early phases. While we aim to develop and use AI responsibly and attempt to mitigate ethical and legal issues presented by its use, we may ultimately be unsuccessful in identifying or resolving issues before they arise. AI technologies are complex and rapidly evolving, and the technologies that we develop or use may ultimately be flawed. Moreover, AI technology is subject to rapidly evolving domestic and international laws and regulations, which could impose significant costs and obligations on the Company. For example, in 2023 the U.S. government issued an executive order on safe, secure and trustworthy AI, and the EU s Artificial Intelligence Act, which establishes EU-wide rules on data quality, transparency, human oversight and accountability with respect to the use of AI, was enacted in August 2024. Emerging regulations may also pertain to data privacy, data protection, and the ethical use of AI, as well as clarifying intellectual property considerations. Our use of AI could give rise to legal or regulatory action or increased scrutiny or liability, and maydamage our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business. 
 Risks Relating to the Macroeconomic Environment and our Global Presence 
 Our business and operating results could be adversely affected by unfavorable changes in macroeconomic and market conditions and any reduction in the level of customer spending in response. 
 Our business and operating results depend significantly on general market and economic conditions. Market volatility and weakness in the regions in which we operate have previously resulted in sustained periods of decreased demand that have adversely affected our operating results. The current global macroeconomic environment is volatile and continues to be significantly and adversely impacted by inflation, geopolitical trends impacting global supply chains, and a dynamic environment for customer spending. Market conditions could also be adversely affected by a variety of political, economic or other factors in the United States and international markets that could in turn adversely affect spending levels of our customers and their end users, and could create volatility or deteriorating conditions in the markets in which we operate. Due to our concentration of revenue in the United States, we would expect to incur a more significant impact from any adverse change in the capital spending environment or market weakness in the United States. Macroeconomic uncertainty or weakness could result in: 
 reductions in customer spending and delay, deferral or cancellation of network infrastructure initiatives; 
 increased competition for fewer network projects and sales opportunities; 
 increased pricing pressure that may adversely affect revenue, gross margin and profitability; 
 decreased ability to forecast operating results and make decisions about budgeting, planning and future investments; 
 increased overhead and production costs as a percentage of revenue; 
 tightening of credit markets needed to fund capital expenditures by us or our customers; 
 customer financial difficulty, including order cancellations, delivery deferrals, longer collection cycles and difficulties collecting accounts receivable or write-offs of receivables; 
 business and financial difficulties faced by our suppliers or other partners, including impacts to material costs, sales, liquidity levels, ability to continue investing in their businesses, ability to import or export goods, ability to meet development commitments and manufacturing capability; and 
 increased risk of charges relating to excess and obsolete inventories and the write-off of other intangible assets. 
 Reductions in customer spending in response to unfavorable or uncertain macroeconomic and market conditions, globally or in a particular region where we operate, would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 The international scale of our sales and operations exposes us to additional risk and expense that could adversely affect our results of operations. 
 29 

Table of Contents 

 We market, sell and service our products globally, maintain personnel in numerous countries, and rely on a global supply chain for sourcing important components and manufacturing our products. Our international sales and operations are subject to inherent risks, including: 
 adverse social, political and economic conditions, such as continued inflation and rising interest rates; 
 effects of adverse changes in currency exchange rates; 
 greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods; 
 difficulty and cost of staffing and managing foreign operations; 
 higher incidence and risk of corruption or unethical business practices; 
 less protection for intellectual property rights in some countries; 
 tax and customs changes that adversely impact our global sourcing strategy, manufacturing practices, transfer-pricing, or competitiveness of our products for global sales; 
 compliance with certain testing, homologation or customization of products to conform to local standards; 
 significant changes to free trade agreements, trade protection measures, tariffs and other import measures, such as those proposed by the incoming U.S. administration, export compliance, economic sanctions measures, domestic preference procurement requirements, qualification to transact business and additional regulatory requirements; 
 natural disasters and severe weather events (including related to climate change), acts of war or terrorism, and public health emergencies or pandemics; and 
 uncertain economic, legal and geopolitical conditions in Europe, Asia and other regions where we do business, including, for example, as a result of continued impacts of Brexit on the relationship between the United Kingdom and Europe, the ongoing military conflicts between both Russia and Ukraine and Israel and groups based in surrounding regions, including related maritime impacts in the Red Sea, and changes in China-Taiwan and U.S.-China relations. 
 
 We utilize a sourcing strategy that emphasizes global procurement of materials, and that has direct or indirect dependencies upon a number of vendors with operations in the Asia-Pacific region. Our international operations are subject to complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, including trade regulations, anti-bribery and corruption laws, antitrust or competition laws, and data privacy laws, such as the GDPR, among others. In particular, recent years have seen a substantial increase in anti-bribery law enforcement activity by U.S. regulators, and we currently operate and seek to operate in many parts of the world that are recognized or perceived as having greater potential for corruption. Violations of any of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to offer our products and services in certain geographies, and significant harm to our business reputation. Our policies and procedures to promote compliance with these laws and regulations and, to mitigate these risks, may not protect us from all acts committed by our employees or third-party vendors, including contractors, agents and services partners or from the misinterpretation or changing application of such laws. Additionally, the costs of complying with these laws (including the costs of investigations, auditing and monitoring) could adversely affect our current or future business. 
 Our business, operations and financial results could also be adversely impacted by instability, disruption or destruction in a significant geographic region, including as a result of war, terrorism, riot, civil insurrection or social unrest; natural or man-made disasters; severe weather events; public health emergencies; or economic instability or weakness. For example, in February 2022, armed conflict escalated between Russia and Ukraine. The United States and certain other countries have imposed sanctions on Russia (and Belarus for its support of Russia) and could impose further sanctions, which could damage or disrupt international commerce and the global economy. We are complying with a broad range of U.S. and international sanctions and export control requirements imposed on Russia and, in March 2022, we announced our decision to suspend our business operations in Russia. Although this decision did not materially impact our results of operations for fiscal 2022 or 2023 due to the limited amount of business that we conducted in Russia historically, it is not possible to predict the broader or longer-term consequences of this conflict, which could include further sanctions, export control and import restrictions, embargoes, regional instability, geopolitical shifts and adverse effects on macroeconomic conditions, security conditions, currency exchange rates and financial markets. In addition, the conflict between Israel and groups based in surrounding regions, and related regional impacts have resulted in damage to submarine cables in the Red Sea and disruption of networks using those cables, which could impact future projects by our customers in this region. Such geopolitical instability and uncertainty could have a negative impact on our ability to sell to, ship products to, collect payments from, and support customers in certain countries and regions based on trade restrictions, sanctions, embargoes and export control law restrictions, and logistics restrictions including closures of air space, and could increase the costs, risks and adverse impacts from supply chain and logistics challenges. 
 The success of our International sales and operations will depend, in large part, on our ability to anticipate and manage these risks effectively. Our failure to manage any of these risks could harm our international operations, reduce our international sales, and could give rise to liabilities, costs or other business difficulties that could adversely affect our operations and financial results.

 Efforts to increase our sales and capture market share in targeted international markets may be unsuccessful. 
 Part of our business and growth strategy is to expand our geographic reach and increase market share in international markets through a combination of direct and indirect sales resources. We are also aggressively pursuing opportunities with service provider customers in additional geographies, including in Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia. This diversification of our markets and customer base has been a significant component of the growth of our business in recent years. Our efforts to continue to increase our sales and capture market share in international markets may ultimately be unsuccessful or may adversely impact our financial results, including our gross margin. Our failure to continue to increase our sales and market share in international markets could limit our growth and could harm our results of operations. 
 We may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. 
 
 As a company with global operations, we face exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. Due to our global presence, a portion of our revenue, operating expense and assets and liabilities are non-U.S. Dollar denominated and therefore subject to foreign currency fluctuation. We face exposure to currency exchange rates as a result of the growth in our non-U.S. Dollar denominated operating expense in Canada, Europe, Asia and Latin America. An increase in the value of the U.S. Dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the United States where we sell in U.S. Dollars, and a weakened U.S. Dollar could increase the cost of local operating expenses and procurement of materials or service that we purchase in foreign currencies. From time to time, we hedge against currency exposure associated with anticipated foreign currency cash flows or assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency. Such attempts to offset the impact of currency fluctuations are costly, and we cannot hedge against all foreign exchange rate volatility. Losses associated with these hedging instruments and the adverse effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation may negatively affect our results of operations. 
 Risks Related to Our Operations and Reliance on Third Parties 
 We may experience delays in the development and production of our products that may negatively affect our competitive position and business. 
 Our hardware and software networking solutions, including our WaveLogic modem technology and the components thereof, are based on complex technology, and we can experience unanticipated delays in developing, manufacturing and introducing these solutions to market. Delays in product development efforts by us or our third-party partners may affect our reputation with customers, affect our ability to capture market opportunities and impact the timing and level of demand for our products. We are regularly introducing new products and enhancements and each step in their development cycle presents serious risks of failure, rework or delay, any one of which could adversely affect the cost-effectiveness and timely development of our products. Reworks, in particular, if required, can be a very expensive and time-consuming effort. We may encounter delays relating to engineering development activities and software, design, sourcing and manufacture of critical components, and the development of prototypes. The development of new technologies may increase the complexity of supply chain management or require the acquisition, licensing or interworking with the technology of third parties. In addition, intellectual property disputes, failure of critical design elements and other execution risks may delay or even prevent the release of these products. If we do not successfully develop or produce products in a timely manner, our competitive position may suffer, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. 
 We rely on third-party contract manufacturers, and our business and results of operations may be adversely affected by risks associated with their businesses, financial condition, and the geographies in which they operate. 
 We rely on third-party contract manufacturers, including those with facilities in Canada, Mexico, Thailand, and the United States, to perform a substantial portion of our supply chain activities, including component sourcing, manufacturing, product testing and quality, and fulfillment and logistics relating to the distribution and support of our products. There are a number of risks associated with our dependence on contract manufacturers, including: 
 
 reduced control over delivery schedules and planning; 
 reliance on the quality assurance procedures of third parties; 
 potential uncertainty regarding manufacturing yields and costs; 
 availability of manufacturing capability and capacity, particularly during periods of high demand; 
 the impact of wage inflation and labor shortages on cost; 
 the impact of supply chain constraints on our contract manufacturers costs and business models; 
 risks associated with the ability of our contract manufacturers to perform to our manufacturing needs; 
 31 

Table of Contents 

 the impact of commercial or contractual disputes on our relationships with or the performance of our manufacturing partners; 
 risks and uncertainties associated with the locations or countries where our products are manufactured, including disruption of manufacturing, logistics, or transit to final destinations caused by factors such as natural and man-made disasters, severe weather events, information technology system failures, commercial disputes, economic, business, labor, political, social, geopolitical, environmental, trade, or public health; 
 risks associated with data security incidents, including disruptions, interdiction, or cyber-attacks targeting or affecting our third-party manufacturers, including manufacturing disruptions or unauthorized access to or acquisition of information; 
 changes in law or policy governing tax, trade, manufacturing, development, and investment in the countries where we currently manufacture our products, including the World Trade Organization Information Technology Agreement or other free trade agreements; 
 inventory liability for excess and obsolete supply; 
 limited warranties provided to us; and 
 potential misappropriation of our intellectual property. 
 
 In addition, a range of physical and transitional risks related to climate change in the regions in which our contract manufacturers operate could have short-term or long-term adverse impacts on our business. Physical impacts could include severe weather events occurring more frequently or with more intensity, or changing weather patterns. This could impact the cost and availability of raw materials and other product inputs, disrupt our supply chain operations, manufacturing and distribution of our products, result in facilities closures, repairs or retrofitting, that could have an adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition. 
 If our contract manufacturers are unable or unwilling to manufacture our products or components of our products to our expected level of performance, or if we experience a disruption in manufacturing, we may be required to identify and qualify alternative manufacturers. The process of qualifying a new contract manufacturer and commencing volume production is complex and time-consuming, and such transitions can be disruptive and costly. There can be no assurance that such transitions would not result in significant business disruption, including shipment delays or inability to meet our customer requirements that impact our revenue. These and other risks associated with our contract manufacturers businesses, financial condition, and the geographies in which they operate could impair our ability to fulfill orders, harm our sales and impact our reputation with customers in ways that adversely impact our business and results of operations. 
 
 Our reliance on third-party component suppliers, including sole and limited source suppliers, exposes our business to additional risk, including risk relating to our suppliers businesses and financial position and risks arising as a result of geopolitical events, and could limit our sales, increase our costs and harm our customer relationships. 
 We maintain a global sourcing strategy and depend on a diverse set of third-party suppliers in international markets that comprise our supply chain. We rely on these third parties for activities relating to product design, development and support, and in the sourcing of products, components, subcomponents and related raw materials. Our products include optical and electronic components for which reliable, high-volume supply is often available only from sole or limited sources. We do not have any guarantees of supply from our third-party suppliers, and in certain cases we have limited contractual arrangements or are relying on standard purchase orders. In recent periods, delays and lower-than-expected deliveries from a small group of our suppliers of integrated circuit components that are essential for delivering finished products had a disproportionate, adverse impact on our results of operations. There is no assurance that we will be able to secure the components or subsystems that we require, in sufficient quantity and quality, within our preferred timelines and on reasonable terms. 
 
 The loss of a source of supply, or lack of sufficient availability of key components, could require that we locate an alternate source or redesign our products, either of which could result in business interruption and increased costs. Increases in market demand or scarcity of raw materials or components have resulted, and may in the future result, in shortages in availability of important components for our solutions, supply allocation challenges, deployment delays and increased cost, lead times and delivery cycle timelines. There are a number of significant technology trends or developments underway or emerging including AI, the IoT, autonomous vehicles, and advances in mobile communications such as 5G technologies that have previously resulted in, and we believe will continue to result in, increased market demand for key raw materials or components upon which we rely. 
 
 A number of our key technology vendors rely upon sales to customers, including our competitors, in China for a material portion of their revenue. There have been a number of significant geopolitical events, including trade tensions and regulatory actions, involving the governments of the United States and China. In May 2019, the U.S. Department of Commerce amended the EAR by adding Huawei and certain affiliates to the Entity List for actions contrary to the national security and foreign 
 32 

Table of Contents 

 policy interests of the United States, imposing significant new restrictions on export, reexport and transfer of U.S. regulated technologies and products to Huawei. In August 2020, the U.S. Department of Commerce added additional Huawei affiliates to the Entity List, confirmed the expiration of a temporary general license applicable to Huawei and amended the foreign direct product rule in a manner that represents a significant expansion of its application to Huawei. More recently, the U.S. Department of Commerce has expanded the scope of the EAR by amending the foreign direct product rule, resulting in more products made outside the United States becoming subject to the EAR for purposes of exports or transfers to certain countries and/or parties, which increases compliance risks and licensing obligations for companies dealing with such products. Several of our third-party component suppliers, including certain sole and limited source suppliers, sell products to Huawei and, in some cases, Huawei is a significant customer for such suppliers. At this time, there can be no assurance regarding the scope or duration of these restrictions, including the foreign direct product rule, or further actions imposed on Huawei and other companies located and operating in China, and any future impact on our suppliers. Any continued restriction on our suppliers ability to make sales to Huawei and other companies may adversely impact their businesses and financial position. In addition, China is in the midst of executing a five-year plan to improve China s capabilities in the optoelectronics industry. There can be no assurance that this initiative, or similar efforts in China such as the Made in China 2025 initiatives (and actions taken by the U.S. government in response to such efforts), will not have an adverse impact on the business of our suppliers or our access to necessary components. These and similar industry, market and regulatory disruptions affecting our suppliers could, in turn, expose our business to loss or lack of supply or discontinuation of components that could result in lost revenue, additional product costs, increased lead times and deployment delays that could harm our business and customer relationships. Our business and results of operations would be negatively affected if we were to experience any significant disruption or difficulties with key suppliers affecting the price, quality, availability or timely delivery of required components. 
 
 We rely on third-party resellers, distributors and service partners, and our failure to manage these relationships effectively could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and relationships with our customers. 
 
 To complement our global field resources, we rely on a number of third-party resellers, distributors and sales agents, both domestic and international, and we believe that these relationships are an important part of our business. There can be no assurance that we will successfully identify and qualify these resources or that we will realize the expected benefits of these sales relationships. We also rely on a number of third-party service partners, both domestic and international, to complement our global service and support resources. We rely on these partners for certain installation, maintenance and support functions and may increasingly use them for an expanding range of design, construction, integration and operation of networks, to address customer requirements. Certain service partners may provide similar services for other companies, including our competitors. We may not be able to manage our relationships with our service partners effectively, and we cannot be certain that they will be able to perform necessary services in the manner or time required, that we will be able to maintain the continuity of their services, or that they will adhere to ethical business practices. We may also be exposed to a number of risks or challenges relating to the performance of our service partners, including: 
 delays in recognizing revenue; 
 liability for injuries to persons, damage to property or other claims relating to the actions or omissions of our service partners; 
 our services revenue and gross margin may be adversely affected; and 
 our relationships with customers could suffer. 
 We must assess and qualify distribution partners, third-party resellers, sales agents and service partners in order to ensure their understanding of, and willingness and ability to adhere to, our standards of conduct and business ethics. Certain third-party business partners may not have the same operational history, financial resources and scale that we have. We may be held responsible or liable for the actions or omissions of these third parties or their violations of law. If we do not effectively manage our relationships with these third-party business partners, our business, financial results and relationships with customers could be adversely affected. 
 We may be exposed to unanticipated risks and additional obligations in connection with our resale of complementary products or technology of other companies. 
 We have entered into agreements with strategic supply partners that permit us to distribute their products or technology. We may rely on these relationships to add complementary products or technologies, to diversify our product portfolio, or to address a particular customer or geographic market. We may enter into additional OEM, resale or similar strategic arrangements in the future. We may incur unanticipated costs or difficulties relating to our resale of third-party products. Our third-party relationships could expose us to risks associated with the business, financial condition, intellectual property rights and supply chain continuity of such partners, as well as delays in their development, manufacturing or delivery of products or technology. We may also be required by customers to assume warranty, indemnity, service and other commercial obligations, including potential liability to customers. These liabilities could exceed the commitments, if any, made to us by our technology partners. 
 33 

Table of Contents 

 Some of our strategic supply partners are relatively small companies with limited financial resources. If they are unable to satisfy their obligations to us or our customers, we may have to expend our own resources to satisfy these obligations. Exposure to these risks could harm our reputation with key customers and could negatively affect our business and our results of operations. 
 Growth of our business is dependent on the proper functioning and scalability of our internal business processes and information systems. Adoption of new systems, modifications or interruptions of services may disrupt our business, processes and internal controls. 
 We rely on internal business processes and information systems to support key business functions, and the efficient operation of these processes and systems is critical to managing our business. Our business processes and information systems must be sufficiently scalable to support the growth of our business and may require modifications or upgrades that expose us to operational risks. We regularly pursue initiatives to transform and optimize our business operations through the reengineering of certain processes, investment in automation, and engagement of strategic partners or resources to assist with certain business functions. For example, to enhance operational efficiency and modernize our supply chain operations, we are pursuing a number of digital technology transformation efforts, including advanced analytics, automation, and other digital solutions. In addition, our business may begin to operate in new markets and through new supply chain models that may require different internal processes to manage. These changes require a significant investment of capital and human resources and may be costly and disruptive to our operations, and they could impose substantial demands on management time. These changes may also require changes in our information systems, modification of internal control procedures and significant training of employees or third-party resources. Our IT systems, and those of third-party IT providers or business partners, may also be vulnerable to damage or disruption caused by circumstances beyond our control, including catastrophic events, power anomalies or outages, natural disasters, severe weather events, or impacts of climate change, data security related incidents, and computer system or network failures. There can be no assurance that our business systems or those of our third-party business partners will not be subject to similar incidents, exposing us to significant cost, reputational harm and disruption or damage to our business. 
 Restructuring activities could disrupt our business and affect our results of operations. 
 We have taken steps, including reductions in force, office closures, and internal reorganizations to reduce the cost of our operations, improve efficiencies, or realign our organization and staffing to better match our market opportunities and our technology development initiatives. We may take similar steps in the future as we seek to realize operating synergies, to achieve our target operating model and profitability objectives, or to reflect more closely changes in the strategic direction of our business or the evolution of our site strategy and workplace. These changes could be disruptive to our business, including our research and development efforts, and could result in significant expense, including accounting charges for inventory and technology-related write-offs, workforce reduction costs and charges relating to consolidation of excess facilities. Substantial expense or charges resulting from restructuring activities could adversely affect our results of operations and use of cash in those periods in which we undertake such actions. 
 If we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel, we may be unable to manage our business effectively. 
 Our future success and ability to maintain a technology leadership position depend upon our ability to recruit and retain the services of executive, engineering, sales and marketing, and support personnel. Competition to attract and retain highly skilled technical, engineering and other personnel with experience in our industry is intense, and our employees have been the subject of targeted hiring by our competitors. Competition is particularly intense in certain jurisdictions where we have research and development centers, including the Silicon Valley area of northern California, and for engineering talent generally. The lasting impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in higher employee costs, increased attrition, and significant shifts in the labor market and employee expectations. We may experience difficulty retaining and motivating existing employees and attracting qualified personnel to fill key positions. In addition, labor shortages and employee mobility may make it more difficult to hire and retain employees. None of our executive officers is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term. Because we rely on equity awards as a significant component of compensation, particularly for our executive team, a lack of positive performance in our stock price, reduced grant levels, or changes to our compensation program may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key employees. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel, we may be unable to manage our business effectively, and our operations and financial results could suffer. 
 In addition, a number of our team members are foreign nationals who rely on visas or work-entry permits in order to legally work in the United States and other countries. Changes in government policy and global events, such as pandemics, may interfere with our ability to hire or retain personnel who require these visas or entry permits. Our business may be materially adversely affected if legislative or administrative changes to immigration or visa laws and regulations impair our hiring processes or projects involving personnel who are not citizens of the country where the work is to be performed. For example, potential changes in U.S. immigration policy and regulations, including potential changes following the recent U.S. federal elections, such as the implementation of restrictive interpretations by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services of 
 34

 regulatory requirements for H-1B, L-1 and other U.S. work visa categories, may also adversely affect our ability to hire or retain key talent, which could have an impact on our business operations. 
 Risks Related to Intellectual Property, Litigation, Regulation and Government Policy 
 Our intellectual property rights may be difficult and costly to enforce. 
 
 We generally rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secret laws to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our products and technology. Although we own numerous patents, and other patent applications are currently pending, there can be no assurance that any of these patents or other proprietary rights will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or that our rights will provide us with any competitive advantage. In addition, there can be no assurance that patents will be issued for our pending applications or that claims allowed on any patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. Further, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. 
 We are subject to the risk that third parties may attempt to access, divert or use our intellectual property without authorization. We are also vulnerable to third parties who illegally distribute or sell counterfeit, stolen, or unfit versions of our products, which could have a negative impact on our reputation and business. Protecting against the unauthorized use of our products, technology and other proprietary rights is difficult, time-consuming and expensive, and we cannot be certain that the steps that we are taking will detect, prevent or minimize the risks of such unauthorized use. In addition, our intellectual property strategy must continually evolve to protect our proprietary rights in new solutions, including our software solutions. Litigation may be necessary to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity or scope of the proprietary rights of others. Such litigation could result in substantial cost and diversion of management time and resources, and there can be no assurance that we will obtain a successful result. Any inability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could harm our ability to compete effectively. 
 We may incur significant costs in response to claims by others that we infringe upon their intellectual property rights. 
 From time to time third parties may assert claims or initiate litigation or other proceedings related to patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to our business. We have been subject to several claims related to patent infringement, and we have been requested to indemnify customers pursuant to contractual indemnity obligations relating to infringement claims made by third parties. The rate of infringement assertions by patent assertion entities remains high, particularly in the United States. Generally, these patent owners neither manufacture nor use the patented invention directly, and they seek to derive value from their ownership solely through royalties from patent licensing programs. 
 We could be adversely affected by litigation, other proceedings or claims against us, as well as claims against our manufacturers, suppliers or customers, alleging infringement of third-party proprietary rights by our products and technology, or components thereof. Regardless of the merit of these claims, they can be time-consuming, divert the time and attention of our technical and management personnel, and result in costly litigation or otherwise require us to incur substantial costs, including legal fees. These claims, if successful, could require us to: 
 pay substantial damages or royalties; 
 comply with an injunction or other court order that could prevent us from offering certain of our products; 
 seek a license for the use of certain intellectual property, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all; 
 develop non-infringing technology or modify certain products, services, or features, which could require significant effort and expense and ultimately may not be successful; and 
 indemnify our customers or other third parties pursuant to contractual obligations to hold them harmless or pay expenses or damages on their behalf. 
 Any of these events could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our exposure to risks associated with the use of intellectual property may increase as a result of acquisitions, as we would have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to the acquired technology and the steps taken to safeguard against the risks of infringing the rights of third parties. 
 Our products incorporate software and other technology under license from third parties, and our business would be adversely affected if this technology were no longer available to us on commercially reasonable terms. 
 35 

Table of Contents 

 We integrate third-party software and other technology into our operating system, network management, and intelligent automation software and other products. As a result, we may be required to license certain software or technology from third parties, including competitors. Licenses for software or other technology may not be available or may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms. Failure to obtain or maintain such licenses or other third-party intellectual property rights could affect our development efforts and market opportunities, or could require us to re-engineer our products or to obtain alternate technologies. Third-party licensors may insist on unreasonable financial or other terms in connection with our use of such technology. Our failure to comply with the terms of any license may result in our inability to continue to use such license, which may result in significant costs, harm our market opportunities and require us to obtain or develop a substitute technology. 
 Some of our solutions, including our operating system software, Platform Software, and Blue Planet Automation Software, utilize elements of open source or publicly available software. As network operators seek to enhance programmability and automation of networks, we expect that we and other communications networking solutions vendors will increasingly contribute to and use technology or open source software developed by standards setting bodies or other industry forums that seek to promote the integration of network layers and functions. The terms of such licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products. This increases our risks associated with our use of such software and may require us to seek licenses from third parties, to re-engineer our products, or to discontinue the sale of such solutions. Difficulty obtaining and maintaining technology licenses with third parties may disrupt development of our products, increase our costs and adversely affect our business. 
 Data security breaches and cyber-attacks targeting our enterprise technology environment and assets could compromise our intellectual property, technology or other sensitive information and could cause significant damage to our business, reputation and operational capacity. 
 In the ordinary course of our business, our network environment and assets, and the networks and assets of our third-party business partners, including our supply chain and other vendors, maintain certain information that is confidential, regulated, proprietary or otherwise sensitive in nature to our business. This information may include intellectual property and product information, personal data, financial information and other confidential business information relating to us and our employees, customers, suppliers and other business partners. The frequency, sophistication and unpredictability of cybersecurity events globally have increased, and can be more acute during times of geopolitical tension or instability between countries. In addition, companies in the technology industry, and in particular, manufacturers of networking and communications products, have been increasingly subjected to a wide variety of data security incidents, including cyber-attacks, attacks against products, and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to network assets, infrastructure or sensitive information. Our network systems, devices, storage and other business applications, and those that we rely on, and that are maintained by our third-party providers, have been in the past, and may be in the future, subjected to security incidents including attack, exploitation, intrusion, disruption and other malfeasance or attempts to gain unauthorized access or conduct other unauthorized activities. Further, our network systems, devices, storage and other business applications may be targeted for data security incidents as a vicarious method to target our customers. Such data security incidents may be caused by malice or negligence from either third-party or internal actors. These threats arise from actions by nation states, independent hackers, hacktivist groups, organized cybercrime entities, and other third parties, as well as from malicious actors from within or supporting our organization. Further, evolving technologies, including AI, pose new threats. In some cases, it is difficult to anticipate, detect or identify indicators of such incidents and assess the damage caused thereby. If an actual or perceived data security incident affects our network or any of our third-party providers networks, we could incur significant costs, our technology and operations could be impacted, our customers and other stakeholders and/or their network environments could be impacted, our reputation could be harmed, and we may become involved in litigation, including with respect to allegations of breach of contract. We may also be subject to increased regulatory oversight, including governmental investigations, enforcement actions, and regulatory fines. We could also experience delays in reporting our financial results, and we may lose revenue and profits as a result of our inability to timely produce, distribute, invoice, and collect payments for our products and services. Additionally, a data security incident may result in significant remediation expenses and increased cybersecurity protection and insurance costs. 
 While we work to safeguard our enterprise network systems and products and to diligence the security of our third-party providers to mitigate these potential risks, including through information security policies, employee awareness and training, and other technical, procedural and administrative controls, there is no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to prevent future data security incidents or insider threats. We have been subjected in the past, and expect to be subjected in the future, to a range of incidents including phishing, emails purporting to come from a company executive or vendor seeking payment requests, malware, and communications from look-alike corporate domains, as well as security-related risks created by malicious internal actors internally and our use of third-party software and services. We have also been subject to unauthorized access and exfiltration of confidential data as a result of the exploitation of vulnerabilities involving our use of third-party applications. While these types of incidents to which we have been subjected have not had a material effect on our business, technology, 
 36 

Table of Contents 

 operations or our network security to date, future data security incidents could compromise material confidential or otherwise protected information, seize, destroy or corrupt data, impact our customers data or systems through attacks on our products in our customers environments, or otherwise disrupt our operations or impact our customers or other stakeholders. We and our network environment may also be subject in the future to ransomware attacks, nation-state cyber attacks or other types of cyber attacks. A failure to promptly disclose such material incidents as required by law may result in additional financial or regulatory consequences. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, expenses to comply with cybersecurity, privacy, and data protection standards and protocols imposed by law, regulation, industry standards and contractual obligations. Increased regulation of data collection, use and retention practices, and product security regulations, including self-regulation and industry standards, changes in existing laws and regulations, enactment of new laws and regulations, increased enforcement activity, and changes in interpretation of laws, could increase our cost of compliance and operation. And while we may be entitled to damages if our third-party providers fail to satisfy their security-related obligations to us, any award may be insufficient to cover our damages, or we may be unable to recover such award. While we have purchased cybersecurity insurance, there are no assurances that the coverage would be adequate in relation to any incurred losses or not subject to any exclusions. Moreover, as cyber-attacks increase in frequency and magnitude, we may be unable to obtain cybersecurity insurance in amounts and on terms we view as adequate for our operations. 
 
 We are a party to legal proceedings, investigations and other claims or disputes, which are costly to defend and, if determined adversely to us, could require us to pay fines or damages, undertake remedial measures, or prevent us from taking certain actions, any of which could adversely affect our business. 
 In the course of our business, we are, and in the future may be, a party to legal proceedings, investigations and other claims or disputes, which have related and may relate to subjects including commercial transactions, intellectual property, securities, employee relations, or compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Legal proceedings and investigations are inherently uncertain, and we cannot predict their duration, scope, outcome or consequences. There can be no assurance that these or any such matters that have been or may in the future be brought against us will be resolved favorably. In connection with any government investigations, in the event the government takes action against us or the parties resolve or settle the matter, we may be required to pay substantial fines or civil and criminal penalties and/or be subject to equitable remedies, including disgorgement or injunctive relief. Other legal or regulatory proceedings, including lawsuits filed by private litigants, may also follow as a consequence. These matters are likely to be expensive and time-consuming to defend, settle and/or resolve, and may require us to implement certain remedial measures that could prove costly or disruptive to our business and operations. They may also cause damage to our business reputation. The unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. 
 Changes in trade policy, including the imposition of tariffs and other import measures, increased export control, sanctions and investment restrictions, and efforts to withdraw from or materially modify international trade agreements, as well as other regulatory efforts impacting the import and sale of foreign equipment, may adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition. 
 The United States and various foreign governments have established certain trade and tariff requirements under which we have implemented a global approach to the sourcing and manufacture of our products, as well as distribution and fulfillment to customers around the world. From time to time, the U.S. government has indicated a willingness to revise, renegotiate, or terminate various existing multilateral trade agreements and to impose new taxes and restrictions on certain goods imported into the U.S. Because we rely on a global sourcing strategy and third-party contract manufacturers in markets outside of the U.S. to perform substantially all of the manufacturing of our products, such steps, if adopted, could adversely impact our business and operations, increase our costs, and make our products less competitive in the U.S. and other markets. 
 For example, our supply chain includes certain direct and indirect suppliers based in China who supply goods to us, our manufacturers, or our third-party suppliers. Recently, there have been a number of significant geopolitical events, including trade tensions and regulatory actions, involving the governments of the United States and China. The U.S. government has raised tariffs, and imposed new tariffs, on a wide range of imports of Chinese products, including component elements of our solutions and certain finished goods products that we sell. For example, U.S. tariff policy involving imports from China was subject to a lengthy, now-completed review by the U.S. government in 2023 and the first three quarters of 2024, and the incoming U.S. administration has announced an intent to impose an additional 10 tariff on all imports from China. The U.S. government has also introduced broad new restrictions on imports from China allegedly manufactured with forced labor, and the EU and the UK have recently adopted similar restrictions. China has retaliated by raising tariffs, and imposing new tariffs, on certain exports of U.S. goods to China, introducing blocking measures to restrict the ability of domestic companies to comply with U.S. trade restrictions, and recently prohibiting the export of certain rare minerals from China to the United States, and could take further steps to retaliate against U.S. industries or companies. In May 2020, the U.S. introduced significant further restrictions limiting access to controlled U.S. technology to additional Chinese government and commercial entities, including certain of our 
 37 

Table of Contents 

 competitors based in China. More recently, in October 2022, the U.S. Department of Commerce imposed additional export control restrictions targeting the provision of certain semiconductors and related technology to China that could further disrupt supply chains that could adversely impact our business. In addition, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (the FCC in November 2022 prohibited communications equipment deemed to pose an unacceptable risk to national security from obtaining the equipment authorization that allows the products to be imported, marketed, or sold in the U.S. This prohibition currently includes telecommunications equipment produced by Huawei, its affiliates and subsidiaries, and four other Chinese companies, and additional entities may be subsequently added to this list. In addition, U.S. Department of Treasury s Office of Foreign Assets Control has increasingly designated as Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons SDNs companies in China for their alleged activities involving Russia, Iran, North Korea or forced labor practices in the Xinjiang province of China, and such SDN designation includes not only an asset freeze but also broad prohibitions on any direct or indirect dealings with designated SDNs, or non-designated entities owned by one or more SDNs at 50 or greater level. The situation involving U.S.-China trade relations remains volatile and uncertain, and there can be no assurance that further actions by either country will not have an adverse impact on our business, operations and access to technology, or components thereof, sourced from China. See also the risk factor with the caption beginning Our reliance on third-party component suppliers above. 
 At this time, it remains unclear what additional actions, if any, will be taken by the U.S. or other governments with respect to international trade agreements, the imposition of tariffs on goods imported into the U.S., tax policy related to international commerce, increased export control, sanctions and investment restrictions, import or use of foreign communications equipment, or other trade matters. However, the incoming U.S. administration announced an intent to impose tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China. We estimate that products or components that make up a significant portion of our revenue are either manufactured in or distributed from Mexico. Although the ultimate scope and timing of any such tariffs is indeterminable, if implemented, they could have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Based on our manufacturing practices and locations, there can be no assurance that any future executive or legislative action in the United States or other countries relating to tax policy and trade regulation would not adversely affect our business, operations and financial results. 
 Government regulation of usage, import or export of our products, or our technology within our products, changes in that regulation, or our failure to obtain required approvals for our products, could harm our international and domestic sales and adversely affect our revenue and costs of sales. Failure to comply with such regulations could result in enforcement actions, fines, penalties or restrictions on export privileges. In addition, costly tariffs on our equipment, restrictions on importation, trade protection measures and domestic preference requirements of certain countries could limit our access to these markets and harm our sales. These regulations could adversely affect the sale or use of our products, substantially increase our cost of sales and adversely affect our business and revenue. 
 Changes in government regulations affecting the communications and technology industries and the businesses of our customers could harm our prospects and operating results. 
 The FCC has jurisdiction over many companies in the U.S. telecommunications industry, and similar agencies have jurisdiction over the communications industries in other countries. Many of our largest customers, including service providers and cable and multiservice network operators, are subject to the rules and regulations of these agencies, while others participate in and benefit from government-funded programs that encourage the deployment of network infrastructures. These regulatory requirements and funding programs and related laws are subject to changes that may adversely impact our customers, with resulting adverse impacts on our business. 
 In April 2024, the FCC reclassified broadband internet access service BIAS as a telecommunications service under Title II of the Communications Act and reinstated net neutrality obligations on BIAS providers. States and localities are also increasingly proposing new regulations impacting communications services. Any of these regulations could affect our customers and their legal and compliance costs, with resulting adverse impacts on our business. 
 Changes in regulatory requirements or uncertainty associated with the regulatory environment could delay or serve as a disincentive to investment in network infrastructures by network operators, which could adversely affect the sale of our products and services. Similarly, changes in regulatory tariff requirements or other regulations relating to pricing or terms of carriage on communications networks could slow the development or expansion of network infrastructures and adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. Legislators and regulators have also enacted and may in the future enact laws and rules that impose significant fines or other liability on communications companies that experience cyber attacks, information or security breaches, or technology disruptions or failures. Such events may therefore have an adverse effect on our company or our customers businesses. 
 Separately, certain of our cloud provider customers have been the subject of regulatory and other government actions, including inquiries and investigations, formal or informal, by competition authorities in the United States, Europe and other 
 38 

Table of Contents 

 jurisdictions. For example, in July 2019, the U.S. Department of Justice announced that it would commence an antitrust review into significant online technology platforms, and in September 2019, various state attorneys general announced antitrust investigations involving certain technology companies. In addition, certain committees of the U.S. Congress have held hearings and pursued investigations to consider the businesses associated with these platforms, their impact on competition, and their conduct. Further, in November 2024, reports emerged that the Federal Trade Commission opened an investigation into potentially anticompetitive practices by at least one large company in the cloud computing market. There can be no assurance that these government actions will not adversely impact the network spending, procurement strategies, or business practices of our cloud provider customers in a manner adverse to us. 
 Government regulations related to the environment, climate change and social initiatives could adversely affect our business and operating results. 
 Our operations are regulated under various federal, state, local and international laws and regulations relating to the environment and climate change and in many of the jurisdictions in which we operate, governmental authorities are increasingly enacting new legislation and regulations relating to the environment and climate change. These laws and regulations directly impact us and may indirectly impact our operations as a result of required compliance by our customers or supply chain. Inconsistency across laws and regulations may affect the costs of compliance with such laws and regulations. Assessments of the potential impact of future climate change legislation, regulation, and international treaties and accords are uncertain, given the wide scope of potential regulatory change in countries in which we operate. Increased public awareness and worldwide focus on environmental and climate changes may lead to new or strengthened regulations, legislation or other governmental requirements or industry standards, such as increased demand to meet voluntary criteria related to reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and increasing energy efficiency. These requirements will, and other increased regulation of climate change concerns could, subject us to additional costs and restrictions, and could require us to make certain changes to our manufacturing practices and product designs, which could negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position. If we were to violate or become liable under these laws or regulations, we could incur fines, costs related to damage to property or personal injury and costs related to investigation or remediation activities. 
 Our product design efforts and the manufacturing of our products are also subject to evolving requirements relating to the presence of certain materials or substances in our equipment, including regulations that make producers for such products financially responsible for the collection, treatment and recycling of certain products. For example, our operations and financial results may be negatively affected by environmental regulations, such as the WEEE and RoHS regulations that have been adopted by the EU. Compliance with these and similar environmental regulations may increase our cost of designing, manufacturing, selling and removing our products. The SEC requires disclosure regarding the use of conflict minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries (the DRC and disclosure with respect to procedures regarding a manufacturer s efforts to prevent the sourcing of such minerals from the DRC. Certain of these minerals are present in our products. SEC rules implementing these requirements may have the effect of reducing the pool of suppliers that can supply conflict free components and parts, and we may not be able to obtain conflict free products or supplies in sufficient quantities for our operations. Because our supply chain is complex, we may face reputational challenges with our customers, stockholders and other stakeholders if we are unable to verify sufficiently the origins for the conflict minerals used in our products and cannot assert that our products are conflict free. Environmental or similar social initiatives may also make it difficult to obtain supply of compliant components or may require us to write off non-compliant inventory, which could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results. 
 Investor and other stakeholder scrutiny related to our environmental, social and governance practices, and our disclosed performance and aspirations for these practices, may increase costs and expose us to numerous risks. 
 Investors, media, business partners, employees, legislators, regulators, and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on ESG matters, including climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, human and civil rights, and diversity, equity and inclusion. As expectations have changed, we have established and communicated various initiatives, goals and aspirations related to ESG matters. Any disclosed goals and aspirations reflect our current initiatives and plans and assumptions as of the date of their disclosure, involve risks and uncertainties, may require investments, may depend in part on third-party performance or data that is outside our control, are subject to assumptions that could change over time, and may not be achieved. In addition, the standards and laws by which ESG efforts are tracked and measured are in many cases new, have not been harmonized, and continue to evolve. Our efforts to abide by these standards and laws and to accomplish and accurately report on our initiatives, goals and aspirations present numerous operational, reputational, financial, legal, and other risks. Our processes and controls may not always align with evolving standards, our interpretation of standards may differ from others, and standards may continue to change over time, any of which could result in significant revisions to our goals, our reported progress toward those goals, or other ESG information we disclose. In addition, any failure or perceived failure to pursue, further or fulfill our previously stated goals, targets and objectives, satisfy various reporting standards within the timelines we announce, or at all, 
 39 

Table of Contents 

 adhere to our public statements, comply with environmental, social and governance laws and regulations, and meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards, could result in legal and regulatory proceedings against us and materially adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. 
 Changes in tax law or regulation, effective tax rates and other adverse outcomes with taxing authorities could adversely affect our results of operations. 
 Our future effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles, or interpretations thereof. The impact of income taxes on our business can also be affected by a number of items relating to our business. These may include estimates for, and the actual, geographic mix of our earnings; changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets; the use or expiration of net operating losses or research and development credit arrangements applicable to us in certain geographies; and changes in our methodology for transfer pricing, valuing developed technology or conducting intercompany arrangements. 
 
 The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (the OECD has introduced a framework to implement a global minimum tax of 15 for certain highly profitable multinational companies, referred to as Pillar Two or the minimum tax directive. While it is uncertain whether the United States will enact legislation to adopt Pillar Two, certain countries in which we operate have enacted legislation, and other countries are in the process of introducing draft legislation to implement the minimum tax directive. Many aspects of Pillar Two will be effective for Ciena beginning in fiscal 2025 with additional components becoming effective beginning in fiscal 2026. Pillar Two taxes are considered an alternative minimum tax accounted for as a period cost that will impact the effective tax rate in the year the Pillar Two tax obligation arises. Therefore, deferred taxes will not be recognized or adjusted for the estimated effects of future minimum taxes. We have assessed the impact of Pillar Two and do not currently anticipate any material effect on our effective tax rate, financial results or cash flows for fiscal 2025 based on currently enacted laws; however, our analysis is ongoing as the OECD continues to release additional guidance and countries enact legislation. To the extent additional legislative changes take place in the countries in which we operate, it is possible that these changes may yield an adverse impact on our effective tax rate, financial results and cash flows. 
 
 We are subject to the continuous examination of our income and other tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities globally, and we have a number of such reviews underway at any time. It is possible that tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken, and an adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative effect on our financial position and operating results. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from such examinations, or changes in tax law or regulation impacting our effective tax rates, will not have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Failure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and stock price. 
 Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that we include in our annual report a report containing management s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year and a statement as to whether or not such internal controls are effective. Compliance with these requirements has resulted in, and is likely to continue to result in, significant costs and the commitment of time and operational resources. Certain ongoing initiatives, including efforts to transform business processes or to transition certain functions to third-party resources or providers, will necessitate modifications to our internal control systems, processes and related information systems as we optimize our business and operations. Our expansion into new regions could pose further challenges to our internal control systems. We cannot be certain that our current design for internal control over financial reporting, or any additional changes to be made, will be sufficient to enable management to determine that our internal controls are effective for any period, or on an ongoing basis. If we are unable to assert that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective, market perception of our financial condition and the trading price of our stock may be adversely affected, and customer perception of our business may suffer. 
 Risks Related to Our Common Stock, Indebtedness and Investments 
 Our stock price is volatile. 
 Our common stock price has experienced substantial volatility in the past and may remain volatile in the future. Volatility in our stock price can arise as a result of a number of the factors discussed in this Risk Factors section. From fiscal 2020 through fiscal 2024, our closing stock price ranged from a high of 77.60 per share to a low of 34.50 per share. The stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuation that has affected the market price of many technology companies, with such volatility often unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. Divergence between our actual results and our forward-looking guidance for such results, the published expectations of investment analysts, or the expectations of the market generally, can cause significant swings in our stock price. Our stock price can also be affected by market conditions in our industry as well as announcements that we, our competitors, vendors or our customers may make. These may include 
 40 

Table of Contents 

 announcements by us or our competitors of financial results or changes in estimated financial results, technological innovations, the gain or loss of customers, or other strategic initiatives. Our common stock is also included in certain market indices, and any change in the composition of these indices to exclude our company could adversely affect our stock price. In addition, if the market for technology stocks or the broader stock market experiences a loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, financial condition or results of operations. These and other factors affecting macroeconomic conditions or financial markets may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock in the future. 
 
 Outstanding indebtedness under our senior secured credit facilities and senior unsecured notes may adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations and could limit our business. 
 We are a party to credit agreements relating to a 300 million senior secured revolving credit facility, an outstanding senior secured term loan with approximately 1.2 billion due 2030, and an outstanding senior unsecured indenture pursuant to which we issued 400 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.00 senior notes due 2030. The agreements governing these credit facilities contain certain covenants that limit our ability, among other things, to incur additional debt, create liens and encumbrances, pay cash dividends, redeem or repurchase stock, enter into certain acquisition transactions or transactions with affiliates, repay certain indebtedness, make investments, or dispose of assets. The agreements also include customary remedies, including the right of the lenders to take action with respect to the collateral securing the loans, that would apply should we default or otherwise be unable to satisfy our debt obligations. 
 
 Our indebtedness could have important negative consequences, including: 
 
 increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions; 
 limiting our ability to obtain additional financing, particularly in unfavorable capital and credit market conditions; 
 debt service and repayment obligations that may adversely impact our results of operations and reduce the availability of cash resources for other business purposes; 
 limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the markets; and 
 placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage to competitors that have better access to capital resources. 
 
 We may also enter into additional debt transactions or credit facilities, including equipment loans, working capital lines of credit, senior notes, and other long-term debt, which may increase our indebtedness and result in additional restrictions on our business. In addition, major debt rating agencies regularly evaluate our debt based on a number of factors. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our existing debt ratings, and failure to do so could adversely affect our cost of funds, liquidity and access to capital markets. 
 
 Significant volatility and uncertainty in the capital markets may limit our access to funding on favorable terms or at all. 
 The operation of our business requires significant capital. We have accessed the capital markets in the past and have successfully raised funds, including through the issuance of equity, convertible notes and other indebtedness, to increase our cash position, support our operations and undertake strategic growth initiatives. We regularly evaluate our liquidity position, debt obligations and anticipated cash needs to fund our long-term operating plans, and we may consider it necessary or advisable to raise additional capital or incur additional indebtedness in the future. If we raise additional funds through further issuance of equity or securities convertible into equity, or undertake certain transactions intended to address our existing indebtedness, our existing stockholders could suffer dilution in their percentage ownership of our company, or our leverage and outstanding indebtedness could increase. At times, capital market conditions, including the impact of inflation, have increased borrowing rates and could significantly increase our cost of capital should we seek additional funding. Moreover, global capital markets have undergone periods of significant volatility and uncertainty in the past, and there can be no assurance that such financing alternatives will be available to us on favorable terms or at all, should we determine it necessary or advisable to seek additional capital.

 Oversight and Governance 
 Our Board of Directors and the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors (the Audit Committee are responsible for overseeing and assessing management s execution of and approach to cybersecurity risk management. Our Chief Information Security Officer CISO ), who reports directly to our Chief Financial Officer, is primarily responsible for assessing cybersecurity risks and managing our cybersecurity program on a day-to-day basis, with support from other members of senior management. 
 Our CISO is an accomplished security professional with 20 years of experience in cybersecurity and risk management across numerous industries and holds degrees in computer science and information assurance, and additional executive education in building and leading cybersecurity programs. The CISO and his team (the Security Team ), which includes trained cybersecurity professionals, are responsible for implementing and maintaining our cybersecurity strategy and program and its related processes. We also maintain a Security Advisory Committee SAC ), which is chaired by our Chief Financial Officer and composed of members of executive leadership and other functional leaders, including our General Counsel, CISO, Chief Digital Information Officer, and Vice President of Internal Audit. The SAC meets regularly to, among other things, review cybersecurity program developments and serves as a path of escalation and decision-making in certain situations, including incident response. 
 We, and our managed security partners, regularly monitor our environment for indicators of malicious or suspicious activity and security relevant events. The potential risk and impact of any such event is evaluated by a cross-functional team that includes members of our Security Team, legal department and other business functions as necessary and appropriate. Materiality determinations related to escalated events are made by the SAC without unreasonable delay. The CISO, on a quarterly basis, generally provides the Audit Committee a summary of relevant cybersecurity events, with certain events escalated to the Audit Committee outside of these quarterly meetings depending upon their nature. 
 As part of our Board of Directors oversight of risk management, they devote time and attention to cybersecurity related risks. The Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing cybersecurity, data privacy and information technology-related programs, policies and other efforts to manage or mitigate cybersecurity risks. As part of its standing agenda, the Audit Committee receives quarterly updates on cybersecurity risks and initiatives from our CISO. These updates have included reviews of our cybersecurity risk management efforts, including the development of relevant processes and policies, the implementation of technologies and systems, or use of third-party partners to safeguard our information systems, the conduct of education and training initiatives with employees and business partners, and incident response preparedness, including simulations and tabletop exercises. The Audit Committee regularly updates the Board of Directors on such matters. Separately, and in addition to such quarterly reporting, our Board of Directors also receives an annual update from our CISO on information and cybersecurity risks and related initiatives. These Board updates have included briefings from our CISO, as well as external counsel and third-party security advisors, which have included continuing education sessions as our Board of Directors seeks to enhance its understanding of cybersecurity risk, leading practices and an evolving cyber threat landscape. 
 Risk Management and Strategy 
 The safeguarding of information systems, that house employee and customer data, and proprietary information, are of paramount importance to us, our business and our reputation. We maintain a robust and proactive enterprise cybersecurity program designed to identify, assess and manage cybersecurity risks that may impact our business or assets. 
 Cybersecurity Strategy 
 Our cybersecurity strategy focuses on (i) maintaining a cybersecurity framework and set of controls to assess and manage security risks and (ii) protecting against threats by deploying and monitoring security controls and mitigating exposures and potential threats. We maintain a security program designed to align with industry standards, principles, and frameworks, such as those set by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). Our program is also informed by various legal requirements including contractual requirements from our customers. In addition, we maintain internal policies and procedures that govern the measures we take to secure our information technology environment. These include a wide variety of capabilities designed to prevent, detect, or address risks to systems and data. We 
 42 

Table of Contents 

 also employ a range of tools and services, including regular network and endpoint monitoring, penetration testing, and vulnerability assessments, to inform our risk identification and management strategy. 
 Security Risk Management 
 Our Security Team regularly assesses cybersecurity risks, including their likelihood and potential impact, to develop mitigation strategies. The team utilizes enterprise governance, risk, and compliance solutions and tools licensed from third-party vendors to conduct various analytic assessments, including cloud and container security, detection and response, threat intelligence, and application security assessments. We also routinely evaluate and update our understanding of our cybersecurity threat landscape and evolve our related assessments and mitigation strategies accordingly. 
 We regularly review our cybersecurity program for compliance with evolving regulations and to protect against emerging cyber threats. Because we operate in a dynamic threat landscape, we conduct regular reviews of our program and procedures, and we periodically engage third parties to supplement and review our cybersecurity practices. We also maintain a cybersecurity risk insurance policy as part of our risk management efforts, and regularly engage and collaborate with peers, industry groups, and U.S. government partners relating to cybersecurity risk management and the evolving threat environment. 
 We seek to identify and address cybersecurity threats and risks that can arise from our use of third parties, including those that comprise our information systems, supply chain operations or who have access to certain data. We utilize supplier risk management practices, including enhanced due diligence assessments, that seek to identify cybersecurity risks associated with our use of third-party providers and the scope and nature of their work with us. These risks are assessed and prioritized based on, among other things, supplier assessments, threat intelligence, and industry practices. We consider these risks at the time of supplier onboarding and endeavor to assess changes in risk throughout the lifecycle of our relationship with suppliers. 
 Promoting an engaged and aware workforce is a key part of our cybersecurity defense program. We carry out regular security awareness training for our personnel to help them better identify and address potential cybersecurity issues. This includes regular exercises to simulate and detect phishing attempts, various awareness and communication initiatives and required online security awareness training at the time of hire and generally on an annual basis thereafter. 
 Incident Response Readiness 
 We utilize a combination of internal and third-party resources to monitor for threats to our network, systems and data. To promote cybersecurity readiness and advance the preparedness of our teams, our cross-functional incident response teams maintain an incident response plan, in addition to more technical response playbooks, and meet regularly to assess these resources. Among other things, they perform tabletop simulation exercises, internally and with third-party experts, to outline their roles and responsibilities during a cybersecurity event and to refine risk identification and management practices. 
 We have in the past, and may in the future, utilize third-party cyber security assessors or consultants to review our program, to share their findings with our Board of Directors or leadership, and to help identify opportunities for continuous improvement. 
 Additional information about cybersecurity risks we face is discussed in Item 1A of Part I of this annual report, Risk Factors, including under the heading Data security breaches and cyber-attacks targeting our enterprise technology environment and assets could compromise our intellectual property, technology or other sensitive information and could cause significant damage to our business, reputation and operational capacity, which should be read in conjunction with the information above. While we continue to monitor, identify, investigate, respond to, and manage cybersecurity threats, risks and incidents, to date we have not experienced cybersecurity risks, including as a result of previous cybersecurity incidents, that have had a material effect. There can be no assurance that we will not experience such risks in the future.

Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report. 
 
 Overview 
 
 We are a network technology company, providing hardware, software, and services to a wide range of network operators and enabling enhanced network capacity, service delivery, and automation. Our solutions support network traffic across a wide range of applications, including cloud, video, data, AI, and voice. Our network solutions are used globally by communications service providers, cable and multiservice operators, cloud providers, submarine network operators, governments, and enterprises across multiple industry verticals. Our portfolio is designed to enable the Adaptive Network , which is our vision for a network end state that leverages a programmable and scalable network infrastructure, driven by software control and automation capabilities, that is informed by network analytics and intelligence. Our solutions include Networking Platforms, including our Optical Networking portfolio and our Routing and Switching portfolio, which can be applied from the network core to end-user access points, and which allow network operators to scale capacity, increase transmission speeds, allocate traffic efficiently, and adapt dynamically to changing end-user service demands. To complement our Networking Platforms, we offer Platform Software, which includes our Navigator NCS and advanced applications that deliver multi-layer domain control and operations for network operators. Through our Blue Planet Automation Software, we also enable complete service lifecycle management automation with productized OSS, including inventory, orchestration and assurance solutions that help our customers to achieve closed loop automation across multi-vendor and multi-domain environments. 
 
 Market Opportunity and Investment in Technology Innovation 
 
 The market into which we sell our communications networking solutions is dynamic and characterized by a high rate of change, including rapid growth in bandwidth demand and network traffic, the proliferation of cloud-based services and new approaches, or consumption models, for designing and procuring networking solutions. Drivers of increased bandwidth demand include enterprise and consumer cloud network adoption, generative AI, 5G, high-definition video, and network operator focus on resilience and automation. To address these growing service demands and manage network cost, many network operators are looking to adopt next-generation infrastructures that are more programmable and better capable of leveraging data for network insight, analytics and automation. 
 
 We believe that our investment capacity and our efforts to push the pace of innovation are important competitive differentiators in our markets. Keeping pace with the market s demand for technology innovation requires considerable research and development investment capacity and expenditures, and research and development spending represented 19.1 of our operating expenses in fiscal 2024. During fiscal 2024, we invested 767.5 million in research and development activities, an increase of 2.3 compared to fiscal 2023. In particular, in an effort to capture certain market opportunities created by the impact of AI on networks, in fiscal 2024 we continued to innovate, increase the performance of, and enhance the capabilities for our leading WaveLogic coherent modem technology in multiple form factors. Through this innovation we seek to extend our leadership in our core business and leverage this to expand our addressable market into complementary and adjacent network applications, including inside and around the data center. 
 
 Our business strategy to capitalize on these market dynamics and investment opportunities also include the initiatives set forth in the Strategy section of the description of our business in Item 1 of Part I of this annual report. 
 
 Fluctuation in Order Volumes and Impact on Fiscal 2024 Revenue 
 
 During fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022, we received an unprecedented volume of orders for our products and services. We believe some portion of these orders reflected customer acceleration of future orders due to long lead times during the constrained supply environment of that period, as well as orders that were delayed due to the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic. These order volumes resulted in significant revenue growth in fiscal 2023. Our order volumes began to moderate in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, and we experienced order levels below revenue during fiscal 2023 and the first half of fiscal 2024, particularly from our communications service provider customers. We believe this was, in part, due to communications service providers in North America working through relatively high levels of inventory previously acquired, which was made more difficult due to challenges installing and deploying equipment. In addition, in certain international geographies, we believe that caution driven by macroeconomic concerns and market-specific issues contributed to lower-than-expected order volumes from communications service providers during fiscal 2024. As a result of these dynamics, our revenue for fiscal 2024 was lower than our revenue in fiscal 2023. Notwithstanding these recent dynamics and their impact on fiscal 2024 revenue, we 
 47 

Table of Contents 

 continue to believe that certain trends and shifts in business and consumer behaviors and the drivers of bandwidth demand described above under Market Opportunity and Investment in Technology Innovation represent long-term opportunities for our business. 
 
 Fiscal Year-End Backlog 
 
 Generally, we make sales pursuant to purchase orders placed by customers under framework agreements that govern the general commercial terms and conditions of the sale of our products and services. These agreements do not obligate customers to purchase any minimum or guaranteed order quantities. In calculating backlog, we only include (i) customer purchase orders for products that have not been shipped and for services that have not yet been performed; and (ii) customer orders relating to products that have been delivered and services that have been performed, but are awaiting customer acceptance under the applicable contract terms. Backlog may be fulfilled several quarters following receipt of a purchase order, or in the case of certain service obligations, may relate to multi-year support periods. 
 
 Our backlog was 2.1 billion as of November 2, 2024, as compared to 2.6 billion as of October 28, 2023. Backlog includes product and service orders from commercial and government customers combined. Backlog at November 2, 2024 includes approximately 352.5 million primarily related to orders for products and services that are not expected to be filled or performed within fiscal 2025. Because backlog can be defined in different ways by different companies, our presentation of backlog may not be comparable with figures presented by other companies in our industry. In addition, our customers may cancel, delay or change their orders with limited advance notice, or they may decide not to accept our products and services. The timing of our fulfillment of backlog could cause some volatility in our results of operations. 
 
 Stock Repurchase Program 
 On October 2, 2024, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to 1.0 billion of our common stock, commencing in fiscal 2025 and continuing through the end of fiscal 2027. Authorized purchases contemplated under our prior stock repurchase program, which was authorized in fiscal 2022, were completed in fiscal 2024. The amount and timing of any further repurchases under our stock repurchase program are subject to a variety of factors including liquidity, cash flow, stock price and general business and market conditions. The program may be modified, suspended, or discontinued at any time. See Notes 21 and 27 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report . 

Consolidated Results of Operations 
 
 A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023 is presented below. A discussion of fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 can be found under Item 7 of Part II of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 28, 2023, filed with the SEC on December 15, 2023, which is available free of charge on the SEC s website at www.sec.gov and our Investor Relations website at investor.ciena.com.

 Revenue 
 
 Revenue and Currency Fluctuations 
 
 As a result of the factors impacting order volumes described under Overview above, our revenue declined by 8.5 in fiscal 2024 as compared to fiscal 2023. In addition, during fiscal 2024, approximately 14.3 of our revenue was non-U.S. Dollar denominated, primarily including sales in Euros, Indian Rupees and Canadian Dollars. During fiscal 2024, as compared to fiscal 2023, the U.S. Dollar fluctuated against these and other currencies with minimal impact as compared to fiscal 2023.

Our Networking Platforms segment revenue decrease primarily reflects a product line sales decrease of 237.0 million of Optical Networking products, including a sales decrease of 198.3 million of our 6500 Packet-Optical Platform, primarily to communications service providers and enterprise customers. 
 
 In fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, our top ten customers contributed 57.9 and 53.7 of our revenue, respectively. Consequently, our financial results are closely correlated with the spending of a relatively small number of customers and can 
 50 

Table of Contents 

 be significantly affected by market, industry or competitive dynamics affecting the businesses of those customers. Our reliance on a relatively small number of customers increases our exposure to changes in their spending levels, network priorities and purchasing strategies. The loss of a significant customer could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, and our results of operations can fluctuate quarterly depending on sales volumes and purchasing priorities with these large customers. Sales to one of our cloud provider customers were 532.3 million, or 13.3 of total revenue, in fiscal 2024 and 561.4 million or 12.8 of total revenue, in fiscal 2023. Sales to AT T were 475.3 million, or 11.8 of total revenue, in fiscal 2024, and 464.7 million, or 10.6 of total revenue, in fiscal 2023. No other customer accounted for greater than 10 of our revenue in fiscal 2024 or fiscal 2023. 
 
 While drivers of bandwidth growth and network evolution remain strong, many of our service provider customers are under pressure to constrain their capital expenditure budgets, and their businesses cannot grow their network spending at the rate of bandwidth growth. As a result, as we innovate and introduce new and more robust solutions that increase capacity or add features, there is a market expectation for solutions that are more cost-effective than existing or competing solutions and that new products consistently deliver lower price per bit performance. The combination of this regular technology-driven price compression, price competition in our markets, and ongoing customer efforts to manage network costs can impact our growth rates and requires that we increase our volume of product shipments to maintain and grow revenue. 
 
 Cost of Goods Sold and Gross Profit 
 
 Product cost of goods sold consists primarily of amounts paid to third-party contract manufacturers, component costs, employee-related costs and overhead, shipping and logistics costs associated with manufacturing-related operations, warranty and other contractual obligations, royalties, license fees, amortization of intangible assets, cost of excess and obsolete inventory and, when applicable, estimated losses on committed customer contracts. 
 
 Services cost of goods sold consists primarily of direct and third-party costs associated with our provision of services including installation, deployment, maintenance support, consulting and training activities, and, when applicable, estimated losses on committed customer contracts. The majority of these costs relate to personnel, including employee and third-party contractor-related costs. 
 
 Our gross profit as a percentage of revenue, or gross margin, can fluctuate due to a number of factors, particularly when viewed on a quarterly basis. Our gross margin can fluctuate and be adversely impacted depending on our revenue concentration within a particular segment, product line, geography, or customer, as well as our success in selling software in a particular period. Our gross margin remains highly dependent on our continued ability to drive annual product cost reductions relative to the price erosion that we regularly encounter in our markets. Moreover, we are often required to compete with aggressive pricing and commercial terms, and, to secure business with new and existing customers, we may agree to pricing or other unfavorable commercial terms that adversely affect our gross margin. Success in gaining market share and winning new business can result in additional pressure on gross margin from these pricing dynamics and the early stages of these network deployments. Early stages of new network builds also often include an increased concentration of lower margin common equipment, photonics sales and installation services, with the intent to improve margin as we sell channel cards and maintenance services to customers as they add capacity and need to monitor their networks. Gross margin can be impacted by technology-based price compression and the introduction or substitution of new platforms with improved price for performance as compared to existing solutions that carry higher margins. Gross margin can also be impacted by changes in expense for excess and obsolete inventory and warranty obligations. 
 
 Service gross margin can be affected by the mix of customers and services, particularly the mix between deployment and maintenance services, geographic mix and the timing and extent of any investments in internal resources to support this business.

 Gross profit decreased by 159.3 million. Gross margin for fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023 remained consistent, primarily reflecting slightly decreased product margin offset by increased services margin. 
 Gross profit on products decreased by 194.9 million. Product gross margin slightly decreased by 60 basis points, primarily due to a higher concentration of lower margin product mix and higher inventory excess and obsolescence costs partially offset by product cost reductions and improved manufacturing efficiencies. 
 Gross profit on services increased by 35.6 million. Service gross margin increased by 130 basis points, primarily due to improved margins on Blue Planet software services due to improved efficiencies on delivery, partially offset by lower margins on maintenance support and training. 
 
 Operating Expense 
 
 Currency Fluctuations 
 
 During fiscal 2024, approximately 48.7 of our operating expense was non-U.S. Dollar denominated, including Canadian Dollars, Indian Rupees, and Euros. During fiscal 2024 as compared to fiscal 2023, the U.S. Dollar primarily strengthened against these and other currencies with minimal impact as compared to fiscal 2023. 
 
 Operating expense increased in fiscal 2024 from the level reported for fiscal 2023, primarily due to increases in employee headcount. We have also experienced, and are continuing to experience, increases in the cost of labor and other costs of doing business due to inflation, and continued inflationary pressures could have an adverse impact on our profitability. We expect operating expense to continue to increase from the level reported in fiscal 2024 primarily due to planned investment in research and development to advance our strategy and higher employee compensation costs. 
 Operating expense consists of the component elements described below. 
 
 Research and development expense primarily consists of salaries and related employee expense (including share-based compensation expense), prototype costs relating to design, development, product testing, depreciation expense, and third-party consulting costs.

Table of Contents 

 Selling and marketing expense primarily consists of salaries, commissions and related employee expense (including share-based compensation expense) and sales and marketing support expense, including travel, demonstration units, trade show expense, and third-party consulting costs. 
 
 General and administrative expense primarily consists of salaries and related employee expense (including share-based compensation expense) and costs for third-party consulting and other services. 
 
 Significant asset impairments and restructuring costs primarily reflect actions we have taken to improve the alignment of our workforce, facilities and operating costs with perceived market opportunities, business strategies, changes in market and business conditions, the redesign of certain business processes and significant impairments of assets. 
 
 Amortization of intangible assets primarily reflects the amortization of both purchased technology and the value of customer relationships derived from our acquisitions. 
 
 Acquisition and integration costs primarily consist of expenses for financial, legal and accounting advisors and severance and other employee-related costs, associated with our acquisition activity. For more information on our acquisitions, see Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report.

 Research and development expense increased by 16.9 million, net of hedging. This increase primarily reflects increases in employee-related compensation costs, partially due to higher headcount and increases in salary and share-based compensation costs. In addition, facility, information technology costs and other technology related costs increased, partially offset by decreased professional services and a lower provision associated with our annual cash incentive compensation plan. 
 Selling and marketing expense increased by 19.9 million. This increase primarily reflects increases in employee-related compensation costs due to higher variable compensation and share-based compensation, and increases in travel and entertainment costs. 
 General and administrative expense expense increased by 5.4 million. This increase primarily reflects increases in employee-related compensation costs, primarily due to increases in salary and share-based compensation costs. In addition, facility and information technology costs increased, partially offset by a lower provision associated with our annual cash incentive compensation plan. 
 Significant asset impairments and restructuring costs slightly increased, primarily reflecting an increase in workforce reduction costs of 8.5 million, partially offset by a decline of 7.7 million in costs associated with actions to redesign certain business processes associated with our supply chain and distribution structure reorganization and costs related to restructured real estate facilities. For more information on our restructuring costs, see Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report. 
 Amortization of intangible assets decreased by 7.8 million primarily reflecting certain intangible assets having reached the end of their economic lives.

 Interest and other income, net decreased by 11.7 million, primarily resulting from the remeasurement of our previously held investment in Tibit to fair value, in fiscal 2023, which resulted in a gain on our equity investment of 26.5 million and the impact of foreign exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the relevant functional currency, net of hedging activity. These decreases were partially offset by higher interest income on our investments. For more information on our acquisition of Tibit, see Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report. 
 Interest expense increased, primarily due to higher interest rates on our floating rate debt, net of hedging activity, and additional outstanding indebtedness, including the 2030 Term Loan incurred in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. For more information on our short-term and long-term debt, see Note 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report. 
 Loss on extinguishment and modification of debt primarily reflects 1.9 million of extinguishment of debt costs and 6.0 million in debt modification costs, both related to our term loan refinancing which occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. For more information, see Note 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report. 
 Provision for income taxes decreased by 32.9 million, primarily due to the decrease in pre-tax income in fiscal 2024. Similarly, the effective tax rate for fiscal 2024 was higher than the effective tax rate for fiscal 2023, primarily due to the decrease in pre-tax income.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview. For the fiscal year ended November 2, 2024 , we generated 514.5 million of cash from operations. Net income (adjusted for non-cash charges) provided cash of 411.8 million and our working capital provided cash of 102.7 million. For additional details on our cash provided by operating activities, see the discussion below under the caption Cash Provided by Operating Activities. 
 Cash, cash equivalents and investments increased by 82.5 million during fiscal 2024. Cash from operations was partially offset by the following: (i) cash used for stock repurchases under our stock repurchase program of 254.5 million; (ii) cash used to fund our investing activities for capital expenditures totaling 136.6 million; (iii) stock repurchased upon vesting of our stock unit awards to employees relating to tax withholding of 46.6 million; (iv) cash used for our purchase of an equity investment in a privately held technology company of 21.7 million; and (v) cash used for payments on our term loan due October 28, 2030 (the 2030 New Term Loan of 11.7 million. In addition to cash provided by operations, the issuance of equity under our employee stock purchase plans provided 34.3 million in cash during fiscal 2024. 
 See Notes 18 and 21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report for information relating to these transactions. 
 The following table sets forth changes in our cash and cash equivalents and investments in marketable debt securities (in thousands): 
 November 2, 2024 October 28, 2023 Increase (decrease) Cash and cash equivalents 934,863 1,010,618 (75,755) Short-term investments in marketable debt securities 316,343 104,753 211,590 Long-term investments in marketable debt securities 80,920 134,278 (53,358) Total cash and cash equivalents and investments in marketable debt securities 1,332,126 1,249,649 82,477 
 
 Principal Sources of Liquidity . Our principal sources of liquidity include our cash, cash equivalents and investments, which as of November 2, 2024 totaled 1.3 billion, as well as the unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility (as defined in Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report). The Revolving Credit Facility, which we and certain of our subsidiaries entered into on October 24, 2023, replaced the ABL Credit Facility (as defined in Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report) and provides for a total commitment of 300.0 million with a maturity date of October 24, 2028. We principally use the Revolving Credit Facility to support the issuance of letters of credit that arise in the ordinary course of our business and for general corporate purposes. As of November 2, 2024, letters of credit totaling 59.1 million were outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility as of November 2, 2024. 
 Foreign Liquidity . The amount of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments held by our foreign subsidiaries was 161.7 million as of November 2, 2024 . Approximately 93.0 million of future cash generated from these foreign subsidiaries is expected to be repatriated, with any remaining amount continuing to be indefinitely reinvested. A deferred tax liability related to the expected repatriation amount was accrued in fiscal 2023. There are no other significant temporary differences related to our investment in the foreign subsidiaries for which a deferred tax liability has not been recognized. See Note 22 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report. 
 Stock Repurchase Authorization. On December 9, 2021, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to 1.0 billion of our common stock. During fiscal 2024, we repurchased an additional 250.0 million of our common stock under the stock repurchase program, which completed the authorized repurchases contemplated under the current program. On October 2, 2024, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to 1.0 billion of our common stock, commencing in fiscal 2025 and continuing through the end of fiscal 2027. The amount and timing of any further repurchases under our stock repurchase program are subject to a variety of factors including liquidity, cash

 flow, stock price and general business and market conditions. The program may be modified, suspended, or discontinued at any time. See Notes 21 and 27 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report . 
 Liquidity Position. Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that cash from operations, cash, cash equivalents, investments, and other sources of liquidity, including our Revolving Credit Facility, will satisfy our currently anticipated working capital needs, capital expenditures, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations through the next 12 months and the reasonably foreseeable future. We regularly evaluate our liquidity position, debt obligations, and anticipated cash needs to fund our operating or investment plans, and we will continue to consider capital raising and other market opportunities that may be available to us. We regularly evaluate alternatives to manage our capital structure and market opportunities to enhance our liquidity and provide further operational and strategic flexibility.

Table of Contents 

 Purchase Order Obligations. As of November 2, 2024 , we had 1.7 billion in outstanding purchase order commitments to our contract manufacturers and component suppliers for inventory. In certain instances, we are permitted to cancel, reschedule or adjust these orders. Consequently, only a portion of this amount relates to firm, non-cancelable and unconditional obligations. 
 Leases. We have lease arrangements for facilities including research and development centers, engineering facilities and smaller offices in regions throughout the world to support sales and services operations. Office facilities are leased under various non-cancelable operating or finance leases. As of November 2, 2024 , we had fixed lease payment obligations of 106.7 million, with 23.4 million payable within 12 months. See Note 17 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We do not engage in any off-balance sheet financing arrangements. In particular, we do not have any equity interests in so-called limited purpose entities, which include special purpose entities (SPEs) and structured finance entities. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expense, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. By their nature, these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. On an ongoing basis, we reevaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, share-based compensation, bad debts, inventories, intangible and other long-lived assets, goodwill, income taxes, warranty obligations, restructuring, derivatives and hedging, and contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. Among other things, these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. To the extent that there are material differences between our estimates and actual results, our consolidated financial statements will be affected. 
 
 We believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect those areas where significant judgments and estimates are used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Revenue Recognition 
 
 Revenue is allocated among performance obligations based on standalone selling price SSP ). SSP reflects the price at which we would expect to sell that product or service on a stand-alone basis at contract inception and that we would expect to be entitled to receive for the promised products or services. SSP is estimated for each distinct performance obligation and judgment may be required in its determination. The best evidence of SSP is the observable price of a product or service when we sell the products separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, we determine SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. 
 
 We apply judgment in determining the transaction price, as we may be required to estimate variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Variable consideration can include various rebate, cooperative marketing, and other incentive programs that we offer to our distributors, partners and customers. When determining the amount of revenue to recognize, we estimate the expected usage of these programs, applying the expected value or most likely estimate and updates the estimate at each reporting period as actual utilization data becomes available. We also consider any customer right of return and any actual or potential payment of liquidated damages, contractual or similar penalties, or other claims for performance failures or delays in determining the transaction price, where applicable. 
 
 When transfer of control is judged to be over time for installation and professional service arrangements, we apply the input method to determine the amount of revenue to be recognized in a given period. Utilizing the input method, we recognize revenue based on the ratio of actual costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs expected to be incurred. Revenue for software subscription and maintenance is recognized ratably over the period during which the services are performed. 
 
 Our total deferred revenue for products was 19.0 million and 28.4 million as of November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023 , respectively. Our services revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the period during which the services are to be 
 58 

Table of Contents 

 performed. Our total deferred revenue for services was 218.6 million and 200.1 million as of November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023 , respectively. 
 
 Business Combinations 
 
 We record acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting. The assets acquired, liabilities assumed, contractual contingencies and contingent consideration are recognized at their fair value as of the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net tangible and net intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. The application of the purchase method of accounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions in the determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in order to allocate purchase price consideration properly between assets that are depreciated and amortized from goodwill. These assumptions and estimates include a market participant s use of the asset and the appropriate discount rates for a market participant. Our estimates are based on historical experience, information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and, when appropriate, include assistance from independent third-party appraisal firms. Our significant assumptions and estimates can include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future, the appropriate weighted-average cost of capital, and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset. These estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. In addition, unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates. During fiscal 2022, we completed the acquisitions of AT T s Vyatta Software Technology Vyatta and Xelic, Inc. Xelic for an aggregate purchase price of 64.1 million. During fiscal 2023, we completed the acquisitions of Benu and Tibit for an aggregate purchase price of 291.7 million. See Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report for more information regarding these transactions. 
 
 Share-Based Compensation 
 
 We estimate the fair value of our restricted stock unit RSU awards based on the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant. Our outstanding RSU awards are subject to service-based vesting conditions and/or performance-based vesting conditions. We recognize the estimated fair value of service-based awards as share-based expense ratably over the vesting period on a straight-line basis. Awards with performance-based vesting conditions require the achievement of certain financial or other performance criteria or targets as a condition to the vesting, or acceleration of vesting. We recognize the estimated fair value of performance-based awards as share-based expense over the performance period, using graded vesting, which considers each performance period or tranche separately. At the end of each reporting period, for performance based awards not subject to total stockholder return, we reassess the probability of achieving the performance targets and the performance period required to meet those targets, and the expense is adjusted accordingly. Determining whether the performance targets will be achieved involves judgment, and the estimate of expense may be revised periodically based on changes in the probability of achieving the performance targets. Revisions are reflected in the period in which the estimate is changed. If any performance goals are not met, no compensation cost is ultimately recognized against that goal and, to the extent previously recognized, compensation cost is reversed. 
 
 Share-based compensation expense is taken into account based on awards granted. In the event of a forfeiture of an award, the expense related to the unvested portion of that award is reversed. Reversal of share-based compensation expense based on forfeitures can materially affect the measurement of estimated fair value of our share-based compensation. See Note 23 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report for information regarding our assumptions related to share-based compensation and the amount of share-based compensation expense we incurred for the periods covered in this annual report. As of November 2, 2024 , total unrecognized compensation expense was 212.9 million, which relates to unvested RSUs and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.33 years. 
 
 We are required to record excess tax benefits or tax deficiencies related to stock-based compensation as income tax benefit or expense when share-based awards vest or are settled. 
 
 Reserve for Inventory Obsolescence 
 
 We make estimates about future customer demand for our products when establishing the appropriate reserve for excess and obsolete inventory. For fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, future demand was calculated using both customer backlog and future forecasted sales. Generally, our customers may cancel or change their orders with limited advance notice, or they may decide not to accept our products and services. We write down inventory that has become obsolete or unmarketable by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable value based on assumptions about future demand, which are affected by changes in our strategic direction, discontinuance of a product or introduction of newer versions of our products, declines in the sales of or forecasted demand for certain products, and general market conditions. Inventory write downs are a component of our product cost of goods sold. Upon recognition of the write down, a new lower cost basis for 
 59 

Table of Contents 

 that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis. In an effort to limit our exposure to delivery delays and to satisfy customer needs, we purchase inventory based on forecasted sales across our product lines. Beginning in the second half of fiscal 2021, we started placing significant, advanced orders for supply of certain long lead time components to address our expected customer demand for fiscal 2022 and the then-emerging supply chain challenges. During the second half of fiscal 2023, supply for certain long lead time components began to stabilize, and the need to place advance orders decreased for these components. As of November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023, we had 1.7 billion, for both fiscal periods in outstanding purchase order commitments to our contract manufacturers and component suppliers for inventory. In addition, part of our research and development strategy is to promote the convergence of similar features and functionalities across our product lines. Each of these practices exposes us to the risk that our customers will not order products for which we have forecasted sales or will purchase less than we have forecasted. 
 
 We recorded charges for excess and obsolete inventory of 77.3 million, 29.5 million and 16.2 million in fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, primarily related to a decrease in the forecasted demand for certain Networking Platforms products primarily sold to communications service providers. Our inventory, net of allowance for excess and obsolescence, was 820.4 million and 1.1 billion as of November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023 , respectively. 
 
 Allowance for Credit Losses for Accounts Receivable and Contract Assets 
 
 We estimate our allowances for credit losses using relevant available information from internal and external sources. This information is related to past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses. When assessing for credit losses, we determine collectability by pooling assets with similar characteristics. The allowances for credit losses are each measured on a collective basis when similar risk characteristics exist. The allowances for credit losses are each measured by multiplying the exposure probability of default (the probability that the asset will default within a given time frame) by the loss given default rate (the percentage of the asset not expected to be collected due to default) based on the pool of assets. 
 
 Probability of default rates is published by third-party credit rating agencies. Adjustments to our exposure probability may take into account a number of factors, including, but not limited to, various customer-specific factors, the potential sovereign risk of the geographic locations in which the customer is operating and macroeconomic conditions. These factors are updated regularly or when facts and circumstances indicate that an update is deemed necessary. 
 
 Our accounts receivable, net of allowance for credit losses, was 908.6 million and 1.0 billion as of November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023 , respectively. Our allowance for credit losses was 9.9 million and 11.7 million as of November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023 , respectively. 
 
 Our contract assets for unbilled accounts receivable, net of allowance for credit losses, was 127.9 million and 150.3 million as of November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023, respectively. Our allowance for credit losses was 0.4 million and 0.1 million as of November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023, respectively . 
 
 Goodwill 
 
 Our goodwill was generated from the acquisitions of (i) Cyan, Inc. during fiscal 2015, (ii) the high-speed photonics components assets of TeraXion, Inc. during fiscal 2016, (iii) Packet Design, LLC and DonRiver Holdings, LLC during fiscal 2019, (iv) Centina Systems, Inc. during fiscal 2020, (v) Vyatta and Xelic during fiscal 2022 and (vi) Benu and Tibit during fiscal 2023. The goodwill from these acquisitions is primarily related to expected economic synergies. Goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the fair values assigned to the net assets acquired in a business combination. We test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, which we have determined to be as of the last business day of fiscal September each year. We also test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value. 
 
 We test goodwill impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with the unit s carrying amount, including goodwill. Goodwill is allocated to reporting units based on relative fair value using a discounted cash flow model. If this test indicates that the fair value is less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. A non-cash goodwill impairment charge would have the effect of decreasing earnings or increasing losses in such period. If we are required to take a substantial impairment charge, our operating results would be materially adversely affected in such period. As of both November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023, the goodwill balance was approximately 445.0 million. There were no goodwill impairments resulting from our fiscal 2024 and 2023 impairment tests, 
 60 

Table of Contents 

 and no reporting unit was determined to be at risk of failing the goodwill impairment test. See Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report. 
 
 Long-lived Assets 
 
 Our long-lived assets include equipment, building, furniture and fixtures, operating right-of-use assets, finite-lived intangible assets and maintenance spares. As of November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023, these assets totaled 608.1 million and 575.0 million , net, respectively. We test long-lived assets for impairment whenever triggering events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets carrying amount is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows. Our long-lived assets are assigned to asset groups which represent the lowest level for which we identify cash flows. We measure impairment loss as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. 
 
 Deferred Tax Assets 
 
 Pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, we maintain a valuation allowance for a deferred tax asset when it is deemed to be more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the generation of future taxable income (including the reversals of deferred tax liabilities) during the periods in which those deferred tax assets will become deductible. In evaluating whether a valuation allowance is required under such rules, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including prior operating results, the nature and reason for any losses, our forecast of future taxable income, utilization of tax planning strategies, and the dates on which any deferred tax assets are expected to expire. These assumptions and estimates require a significant amount of judgment and are made based on current and projected circumstances and conditions. 
 
 Quarterly, we perform an analysis to determine the likelihood of realizing our deferred tax assets and whether sufficient evidence exists to support reversal of all or a portion of the valuation allowance. The net deferred tax assets as of November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023 were 885.9 million and 809.3 million, respectively, including valuation allowances of 192.4 million and 189.9 million, respectively. We will continue to evaluate future financial performance to determine whether such performance is both sustained and significant enough to provide sufficient evidence to support reversal of all or a portion of the remaining valuation allowance. The value of our net deferred tax asset may be subject to change in the future, depending on our generation or projections of future taxable income, as well as changes in tax policy or our tax planning strategy. 
 
 For further discussion, see Note 22 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report. 
 
 Warranty 
 
 Our liability for product warranties, included in accrued liabilities and other short-term obligations, was 55.3 million and 57.1 million as of November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023, respectively. Our products are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging from one to five years. We accrue for warranty costs as part of our cost of goods sold based on associated material costs, technical support labor costs and associated overhead. Material cost is estimated based primarily on historical trends in the volume of product returns within the warranty period and the cost to repair or replace the equipment. Technical support labor cost is estimated based primarily on historical trends and the cost to support customer repairs within the warranty period. The provision for product warranties, net of adjustments for previous years provisions, was 25.6 million, 31.7 million and 17.4 million for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The provision for warranty claims may fluctuate on a quarterly basis depending on the mix of products and customers in that period. If actual product failure rates, material replacement costs, service or labor costs differ from our estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty provision would be required. See Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report. 
 
 Effects of Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 See Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report for information relating to our discussion of the effects of recent accounting pronouncements.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 We are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. The following discussion about these market risks includes forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in these forward-looking statements. 
 
 Interest Rate Sensitivity. We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. See Notes 6 and 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report for information relating to investments and fair value. These investments are sensitive to interest rate movements, and their fair value will decline as interest rates rise and increase as interest rates decline. The estimated impact on these investments of a 100 basis point (1.0 increase in interest rates across the yield curve from rates in effect as of the balance sheet date would be a 2.7 million decline in value. 
 
 Our earnings and cash flows from operations would be exposed to changes in interest rates because of the floating rate of interest on our 2030 New Term Loan, if such loan were not hedged using floating-to-fixed rate interest rate swaps. See Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report. We have entered into interest rate swaps that fix the floating rate for 350.0 million of our floating rate debt at 2.968 from September 2023 through September 2025, and another 350.0 million of our floating rate debt at 3.47 from January 2023 through January 2028. As such, a 100 basis point (1.0 increase in the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR rate as of our most recent SOFR rate setting would increase our annualized interest expense by approximately 4.6 million on the unhedged portion of our 2030 New Term Loan as recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements. See Notes 15 and 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report for information relating to our 2030 New Term Loan. 
 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Risk. As a global concern, our business and results of operations are exposed to and can be impacted by movements in foreign currency exchange rates. Because we sell globally, some of our sales transactions and revenue are non-U.S. Dollar denominated, with the Euro, Indian Rupee, and Canadian Dollar being our most significant foreign currency revenue exposures. If the U.S. Dollar strengthens against these currencies, our revenue for these transactions reported in U.S. Dollars would decline. For our U.S. Dollar denominated sales, an increase in the value of the U.S. Dollar would increase the real costs of our products to customers in markets outside the United States, which could impact our competitive position. During fiscal 2024, approximately 14.3 of revenue was non-U.S. Dollar denominated. During fiscal 2024 as compared to fiscal 2023, the U.S. Dollar fluctuated against a number of foreign currencies with minimal impact as compared to fiscal 2023. 
 
 With regard to operating expense, our primary exposure to foreign currency exchange risk relates to the Canadian Dollar, Indian Rupee and Euro. If these foreign currencies strengthen against the U.S. Dollar, costs reported in U.S. Dollars will increase. During fiscal 2024, approximately 48.7 of our operating expense was non-U.S. Dollar denominated. During fiscal 2024 as compared to fiscal 2023, the U.S. Dollar primarily strengthened against a number of foreign currencies with minimal impact as compared to fiscal 2023. 
 
 From time to time, we use foreign currency forward contracts to reduce variability in certain forecasted non-U.S. Dollar denominated cash flows. Generally, these derivatives have maturities of 24 months or less and are designated as cash flow hedges. At the inception of the cash flow hedge, and on an ongoing basis, we assess whether the forward contract has been effective in offsetting changes in cash flows attributable to the hedged risk during the hedging period. The derivative s net gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and, upon the occurrence of the forecasted transaction, it is subsequently reclassified to the line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations to which the hedged transaction relates. 
 
 During fiscal 2024, we recorded 11.7 million in foreign currency exchange losses, as a result of monetary assets and liabilities that were transacted in a currency other than the entity s functional currency, and the re-measurement adjustments were recorded in interest and other income, net on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. From time to time, we use foreign currency forwards to hedge these balance sheet exposures. These forwards are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes, and any net gain or loss associated with these derivatives is reported in interest and other income, net. During fiscal 2024, we recorded gains on non-hedge designated foreign currency forward contracts of 1.4 million. See Notes 1, 5 and 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Ciena Corporation 
 
 Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Ciena Corporation and its subsidiaries (the "Company") as of November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income, of changes in stockholders' equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended November 2, 2024, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of November 2, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 
 
 In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended November 2, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of November 2, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. 
 
 Basis for Opinions 
 
 The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 
 Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 
 64 

Table of Contents 

 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 
 Reserve for Excess and Obsolete Inventory 
 
 As described in Notes 1 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company s consolidated inventory balance, net of the allowance for excess and obsolescence, was 820.4 million as of November 2, 2024. Management records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory when an impairment has been identified and has a reserve for excess and obsolete inventory of 107.2 million as of November 2, 2024. Management writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable value based on assumptions about future demand, which are affected by changes in the Company s strategic direction, discontinuance of a product or introduction of newer versions of products, declines in the sales of or forecasted demand for certain products, and general market conditions. 
 
 The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the reserve for excess and obsolete inventory is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when developing their estimate, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort to perform procedures and evaluate the audit evidence obtained relating to the assumptions regarding future demand. 
 
 Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the Company s evaluation of the reserve for excess and obsolete inventory, including controls over the assumptions used within the model. These procedures also included, among others, testing management s process for determining the reserve for excess and obsolete inventory. This included evaluating the appropriateness of the inventory reserve model and the reasonableness of the significant assumptions relating to the future demand. Evaluating the assumptions related to future demand involved evaluating whether the assumptions used were reasonable considering historical demand and expectations regarding future demand. Testing management's process for determining future demand included procedures to evaluate the reliability, completeness and relevance of management's data used in the future demand assumption. Testing the relevance and reliability of the data included evaluating the reasonableness of the long-term demand forecasts and historical activity.

 to days from the invoicing date. Historically, Ciena has not provided any material financing arrangements to its customers. As a practical expedient, Ciena does not adjust the amount of consideration it will receive for the effects of a significant financing component as it expects, at contract inception, that the period between Ciena s transfer of the products or services to the customer and customer payment for the products or services will be one year or less. Shipping and handling fees invoiced to customers are included in revenue, with the associated expense included in product cost of goods sold. Ciena records revenue net of any associated sales taxes. 
 
 Ciena recognizes revenue upon the transfer of control of promised products or services to a customer. Transfer of control occurs once the customer has the contractual right to use the product, generally upon shipment or delivery to the customer. Transfer of control can also occur over time for services, such as software subscription, maintenance, installation, and various professional services as the customer receives the benefit over the contract term. 
 
 Significant Judgments 
 
 Revenue is allocated among performance obligations based on standalone selling price SSP ). SSP reflects the price at which Ciena would expect to sell that product or service on a stand-alone basis at contract inception and that Ciena would expect to be entitled to receive for the promised products or services. SSP is estimated for each distinct performance obligation, and judgment may be required in its determination. The best evidence of SSP is the observable price of a product or service when Ciena sells the products separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, Ciena determines SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. 
 
 Ciena applies judgment in determining the transaction price, as Ciena may be required to estimate variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Variable consideration can include various rebate, cooperative marketing, and other incentive programs that Ciena offers to its distributors, partners and customers. When determining the amount of revenue to recognize, Ciena estimates the expected usage of these programs, applying the expected value or most likely estimate and updates the estimate at each reporting period as actual utilization data becomes available. Ciena also considers any customer right of return and any actual or potential payment of liquidated damages, contractual or similar penalties, or other claims for performance failures or delays in determining the transaction price, where applicable. 
 
 When transfer of control is judged to be over time for installation and professional service arrangements, Ciena applies the input method to determine the amount of revenue to be recognized in a given period. Utilizing the input method, Ciena recognizes revenue based on the ratio of actual costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs expected to be incurred. Revenue for software subscription and maintenance is recognized ratably over the period during which the services are performed. 
 
 Capitalized Contract Acquisition Costs 
 
 Ciena capitalizes and amortizes incremental costs of obtaining a contract considering each customer purchase in combination with the corresponding framework agreement, if applicable, as a contract. Ciena elected to implement the practical expedient, which allows for incremental costs to be recognized as an expense when incurred if the period of the asset recognition is one year or less. If the period of the asset recognition is greater than one year, Ciena amortizes these costs over the period of performance. Ciena considers sales commissions incurred upon receipt of purchase orders placed by customers as incremental costs to obtain such purchase orders. The practical expedient method is applied to the purchase order as a whole, and thus the capitalized costs of obtaining a purchase order is applied, even if the purchase order contains more than one performance obligation. In cases where a purchase order includes various distinct products or services with both short-term (one year or less) and long-term (more than a year) performance periods, the cost of commissions incurred for the total value of the purchase order is capitalized and subsequently amortized as each performance obligation is recognized.

 months or less. Ciena also has interest rate swap arrangements to reduce variability in certain forecasted interest expense associated with its term loans. All of these derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges. Ciena also uses foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the effect of foreign exchange rate movements on its net investments in foreign operations. Generally, these derivatives have maturities of months or less. These derivatives are designated as net investment hedges. At the inception of these hedges, and on an ongoing basis, Ciena assesses whether the derivative has been effective in offsetting changes attributable to the hedged risk during the hedging period. The derivative s net gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and, upon occurrence of the forecasted transaction, is subsequently reclassified to the line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations to which the hedged transaction relates. 
 
 Ciena records derivative instruments in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows within operating, investing, or financing activities consistent with the cash flows of the hedged items.

 Ciena has expanded its manufacturing capacity and accumulating raw materials inventory of components that were available, in some cases with expanded lead times, in an effort to prepare Ciena to produce finished goods more quickly upon the easing of supply constraints for certain common components. During fiscal 2024 Ciena reduced its raw materials inventory of components primarily due to the consumption of raw materials previously purchased. 
 Ciena makes estimates about future customer demand for its products when establishing the appropriate reserve for excess and obsolete inventory. For the periods presented, future demand was calculated using both customer backlog and future forecasted sales. Generally, Ciena s customers may cancel or change their orders with limited advance notice, or they may decide not to accept its products and services. Ciena writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable value based on assumptions about future demand, which are affected by changes in Ciena s strategic direction, discontinuance of a product or introduction of newer versions of products, declines in the sales of or forecasted demand for certain products, and general market conditions. During fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, Ciena recorded a provision for excess and obsolescence of million, million, and million, respectively, primarily related to a decrease in the forecasted demand for certain Networking Platforms products primarily sold to communications service providers. Deductions from the provision for excess and obsolete inventory relate primarily to the sale of previously reserved items and disposal activities.

 As of November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023 , Ciena had forward contracts designated as net investment hedges to minimize the effect of foreign exchange rate movements on its net investments in foreign operations. In April 2024, Ciena terminated a portion of its existing net investment hedges for a cash loss of million, which was recorded to other comprehensive income (loss). Ciena replaced its terminated net investment hedges with new net investment hedges. The notional amount of these contracts was approximately million and million as of November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023 , respectively. These foreign exchange contracts have maturities of months or less and have been designated as net investment hedges. 
 As of November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023, Ciena had forward contracts in place to hedge its foreign exchange exposure in order to reduce the variability in various currencies of certain balance sheet items. The notional amount of these contracts was approximately million and million as of November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023 , respectively . These foreign exchange contracts have maturities of months or less and have not been designated as hedges for accounting purposes. 
 Interest Rate Derivatives 
 Ciena is exposed to floating rates of interest on its term loan borrowings (see Note 18 below) and has hedged such risk by entering into floating-to-fixed interest rate swap arrangements interest rate swaps ). 
 In April 2022, Ciena entered into forward starting interest rate swaps to fix the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR for the first million its floating rate debt at from September 2023 through September 2025 2025 interest rate swaps ). The total notional amount of the 2025 interest swaps was million as of November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023. 
 In January 2023, Ciena entered into interest rate swaps to fix the SOFR rate for an additional million of its floating rate debt at through January 2028 2028 interest rate swaps ). The total notional amount of the 2028 interest rate swaps in effect as of November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023 was million.

 million to extend its maturity date to September 28, 2025. 
 
 On October 24, 2023 (the Closing Date ), pursuant to the Incremental Amendment Agreement to the Credit Agreement (as defined in Note 18 above), Ciena incurred a new senior secured revolving credit facility of million (the Revolving Credit Facility ), which replaced the ABL Credit Facility. Ciena has the option to increase the total revolving commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility to million, subject to certain conditions, including obtaining commitments from one or more lenders.

 include a restriction on the aggregate amount of Incremental Term Loans and certain other indebtedness that can be incurred in the future equal to an amount that would not result in the Total Net Leverage Ratio exceeding to 1.00 at the time of incurrence. 
 
 The obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility are guaranteed by all of Ciena s subsidiaries that currently, or in the future are required to, guarantee the obligations of the 2030 New Term Loan, including, as of the Closing Date, Ciena Communications, Inc., Ciena Government Solutions, Inc., Ciena Communications International, LLC and Blue Planet Software, Inc., and are secured on a pari passu basis with the 2030 New Term Loan by a pledge of substantially all of the assets of Ciena and the guarantors. Upon the occurrence of certain events related to the improvement of Ciena s credit rating and repayment of all secured term loans Investment Grade Events ), all collateral securing the obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility will be released at Ciena s election. 
 
 Under the Revolving Credit Facility, Ciena is also required to maintain certain financial maintenance covenants, including: 
 prior to an Investment Grade Event, a maximum Total Secured Net Leverage Ratio of no greater than to 1.00 as of the end of any period of four fiscal quarters (provided, that in the event Ciena consummates a qualifying acquisition, Ciena can elect to increase the maximum Total Secured Net Leverage Ratio level to to 1.00 for the fiscal quarter in which such qualifying acquisition is consummated and for the next five consecutive fiscal quarters);

 billion of its common stock. On December 13, 2021, Ciena entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (the ASR Agreement with Goldman, Sachs Co. LLC Goldman to repurchase million (the Repurchase Price of its common stock as part of the repurchase program. Under the terms of the ASR Agreement, Ciena paid the Repurchase Price to Goldman, and received approximately million shares of its common stock from Goldman, calculated based on the average of the volume-weighted average prices of Ciena s common stock of for the period from December 14, 2021 to February 11, 2022, less a discount, which completed the repurchases contemplated by the ASR Agreement. Shares repurchased pursuant to the ASR Agreement were immediately retired upon receipt. During the remainder of fiscal 2022, Ciena repurchased an additional million shares of its common stock, for an aggregate purchase price of million, at an average price of per share. 
 During fiscal 2023, Ciena repurchased an additional million shares of its common stock, for an aggregate purchase price of million at an average price of per share. During fiscal 2024, Ciena repurchased an additional million shares of its common stock, for an aggregate purchase price of million at an average price of per share, which completed the authorized repurchases contemplated under the program. In aggregate, Ciena repurchased million shares for an aggregate purchase price of billion, at an average price of per share. 
 On October 2, 2024, Ciena announced that its Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to billion of its common stock, commencing in Ciena s fiscal year 2025 and continuing through the end of Ciena s fiscal year 2027. Ciena may purchase shares at management s discretion in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, in transactions structured through investment banking institutions, or a combination of the foregoing. Ciena may also, from time to time, enter into Rule 10b5-1 plans to facilitate repurchases of its shares under this authorization. The amount and timing of repurchases are subject to a variety of factors including liquidity, cash flow, stock price, and general business and market conditions. The program may be modified, suspended or discontinued at any time. 
 
 The purchase price for the shares of Ciena s stock repurchased is reflected as a reduction of common stock and additional paid-in capital. 
 
 Impact of Inflation Reduction Act 1 Excise Tax on Share Repurchases 
 
 Beginning fiscal 2023, a 1 excise tax on the market value of shares repurchased offset by 1 of the market value of shares issued was implemented. During fiscal 2023, a net excise tax of million was recorded to additional paid-in capital on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. During fiscal 2024, a net excise tax of million was recorded to additional paid-in capital on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 
 Stock Repurchases Related to Restricted Stock Unit Tax Withholdings 
 Ciena repurchases shares of common stock to satisfy employee tax withholding obligations due upon vesting of stock unit awards. The related purchase price of million for the shares of Ciena s stock repurchased during fiscal 2024 is reflected as a reduction to stockholders equity.

 As of November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023 , Ciena had accrued million and million of interest and penalties, respectively, related to unrecognized tax benefits included in other long-term obligations on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Interest and penalties of million, million and million were recorded as a net expense to the provision for income taxes during fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively. If recognized, the entire balance of unrecognized tax benefits would impact the effective tax rate. 
 
 Changes in tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, and interpretations may impact Ciena s tax contingencies. Due to various factors, the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon the resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ from the amounts accrued. It is reasonably possible that within the next twelve months Ciena will receive additional assessments by various tax authorities or possibly reach resolution of income tax controversies in one or more various jurisdictions. These factors could result in changes to our contingencies related to positions on prior years tax filings. Ciena cannot currently provide an estimate of potential changes. As statutes of limitation expire, unrecognized tax benefits including interest and penalties related to contingencies may be reversed, resulting in an income tax benefit. Over the next twelve months,

 million of unrecognized tax benefits may expire, which would result in a net tax benefit. 
 
 As of November 2, 2024 , we have approximately million of undistributed earnings at our foreign subsidiaries that we identified in fiscal 2023 as no longer indefinitely reinvested and million of deferred tax liability remaining on Ciena s Consolidated Balance sheets for the income tax effects related to the future repatriation of these earnings. No additional income tax expense has been provided for any remaining undistributed foreign earnings, or any additional outside basis difference from investments in the foreign subsidiaries, as these amounts continue to be indefinitely reinvested. If remaining undistributed foreign earnings and profits of million were repatriated to the U.S., the provisional amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability, which is primarily related to foreign withholding taxes, is an estimated million; however, the amount may be lower depending on Ciena s ability to utilize tax credits associated with the distribution. Additionally, there are no other significant temporary differences for which a deferred tax liability or asset is not being recognized. 
 
 As of November 2, 2024 , Ciena continues to maintain a valuation allowance of million against its gross deferred tax assets primarily. The valuation allowance is primarily related to state and foreign net operating losses and credits that Ciena estimates that it will not be able to use. 
 
 October 28, 2023 November 2, 2024 
 
 As of November 2, 2024, Ciena had a million net operating loss carry forward for U.S. federal income tax which does not expire, and million net operating loss carry forwards for U.S. state income taxes which begin to expire in fiscal 2027. As of November 2, 2024, Ciena also had a million net operating loss carry forward in non-U.S. jurisdictions which begin to expire in fiscal 2029. Ciena s ability to use U.S. federal net operating losses is subject to limitations pursuant to the ownership change rules of the Internal Revenue Code Section 382.

 million shares, and (ii) increase the recoupment period for misconduct relating to accounting restatements from 12 months to three years. 
 
 The 2017 Plan has a term and authorizes the issuance of awards including stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs), restricted stock, unrestricted stock, stock appreciation rights (SARs), and other equity and/or cash performance incentive awards to employees, directors and consultants of Ciena. Subject to certain restrictions, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors has broad discretion to establish the terms and conditions for awards under the 2017 Plan, including the number of shares, vesting conditions, and the required service or performance criteria. Options and SARs have a maximum term of , and their exercise price may not be less than of fair market value on the date of grant. Repricing of stock options and SARs is prohibited without stockholder approval. Certain change in control transactions may cause awards granted under the 2017 Plan to vest, unless the awards are continued or substituted for in connection with the transaction. 
 
 The 2017 Plan authorizes and reserves million shares for issuance. The number of shares available under the 2017 Plan is also increased from time to time by: (i) the number of shares subject to outstanding awards granted under Ciena s prior equity compensation plans that are forfeited, expire or are canceled without delivery of common stock following the effective date of the 2017 Plan, and (ii) the number of shares subject to awards assumed or substituted in connection with the acquisition

 million and approximately million shares remained available for issuance thereunder. 
 
 Stock Options 
 
 There were stock options granted by Ciena during fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023 or fiscal 2022. There were stock options outstanding as of November 2, 2024. 
 The total intrinsic value of options exercised during fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 was million, million and million, respectively. 
 
 Assumptions for Option-Based Awards 
 
 Ciena recognizes the fair value of stock options as share-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Ciena did not grant any option-based awards during fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023 or fiscal 2022. 
 
 Restricted Stock Units 
 A restricted stock unit is a stock award that entitles the holder to receive shares of Ciena common stock as the unit vests. Ciena s outstanding restricted stock unit awards are subject to service-based vesting conditions and/or performance-based vesting conditions. Awards subject to service-based conditions typically vest in increments over a three or period. However, the 2017 Plan permits Ciena to grant service-based stock awards with a minimum vesting period. Awards with performance-based vesting conditions (i) require the achievement of certain operational, financial or other performance criteria or targets or (ii) vest based on Ciena s total stockholder return as compared to an index of peer companies, in whole or in part. 
 During fiscal 2023, Ciena introduced a benefit pursuant to which, upon completion of of service and reaching age , executive officers who are residents of the United States, the United Kingdom, or Canada, and who provide months notice of their retirement, will receive continued vesting of all of their granted but unvested restricted stock unit RSU awards and a pro-rated amount of their performance stock unit awards and market stock unit awards. Other employees in these and certain other countries will be subject to the same eligibility and notice requirements, but will receive acceleration of their granted but unvested RSU awards upon retirement. This program accelerates the recognition of share-based compensation expense. 
 
 Assumptions for Restricted Stock Unit Awards 
 
 Ciena recognizes the estimated fair value of restricted stock units subject only to service-based vesting conditions by multiplying the number of shares underlying the award by the closing price per share of Ciena common stock on the grant date. Share-based expense for service-based restricted stock unit awards is recognized ratably over the vesting period on a straight-line basis. 
 
 Ciena recognizes the estimated fair value of restricted stock units subject to performance-based vesting conditions other than total stockholder return, by assuming the satisfaction of any performance-based objectives at the target level and multiplying the corresponding number of shares earned based upon such achievement by the closing price per share of Ciena common stock on the grant date. Share-based compensation expense is recognized over the performance period, using graded vesting, which considers each performance period or tranche separately, based on Ciena s determination of whether it is probable that the performance targets will be achieved. At the end of each reporting period, Ciena reassesses the probability of achieving the performance targets and the performance period required to meet those targets. The estimation of whether the performance targets will be achieved involves judgment. Revisions are reflected in the period in which the estimate is changed. If any performance goals are not met, no compensation cost is ultimately recognized against that goal and, to the extent previously recognized, compensation expense is reversed. 
 
 Share-based compensation expense for restricted stock units subject only to service-based vesting conditions and restricted stock units subject to performance-based vesting conditions other than total stockholder return, is recognized only for those awards that ultimately vest. In the event of a forfeiture of an award, the expense related to the unvested portion of that award is reversed. Reversal of share-based compensation expense based on forfeitures can materially affect the measurement of estimated fair value of Ciena s share-based compensation.

 Amended and Restated ESPP 
 Ciena makes shares of its common stock available for purchase under the ESPP, under which eligible employees may enroll in a offer period that begins in December and June of each year. Each offer period includes purchase periods. Employees may purchase a limited number of shares of Ciena common stock at of the fair market value on either the day immediately preceding the offer date or the purchase date, whichever is lower. The ESPP is considered compensatory for purposes of share-based compensation expense. Unless earlier terminated, the ESPP will terminate on April 1, 2031.

 As of the end of the period covered by this annual report, we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 The management of Ciena Corporation is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). 
 The internal control over financial reporting at Ciena Corporation was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: 
 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of Ciena Corporation; 
 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; 
 provide reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of Ciena Corporation are being made only in accordance with authorization of management and the Board of Directors of Ciena Corporation; and 
 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. 
 Management of Ciena Corporation assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of November 2, 2024 . Management based this assessment on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in COSO 2013 Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management determined that, as of November 2, 2024, Ciena Corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting. Management reviewed the results of its assessment with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. 
 PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, independent registered public accounting firm, which audited and reported on the consolidated financial statements of Ciena Corporation included in this annual report, has also audited the effectiveness of Ciena Corporation s internal control over financial reporting as of November 2, 2024 , as stated in its report appearing in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report.

 Foreign Account Assets Reporting Information . Foreign property, including Restricted Stock Units, shares of Stock acquired under the Plan and other rights to receive shares (e.g., Restricted Stock Units) of a non-Canadian company held by a Canadian resident must generally be reported annually on a Form T1135 (Foreign Income Verification Statement) if the total cost of the foreign property exceeds a certain threshold (currently C 100,000) at any time during the year. Thus, such Restricted Stock Units must be reported - generally at a nil cost - if the applicable threshold is exceeded because other foreign property is held by you. When shares of Stock are acquired, their cost generally is the adjusted cost base ACB of the shares. The ACB would ordinarily equal the fair market value of the shares at the time of acquisition, but if you own other shares of the same company, this ACB may have to be averaged with the ACB of the other shares. You should consult with your personal tax advisor to determine your reporting requirements.

Ciena Corporation 
 Insider Trading Policy 
 Rev. D (February 2023) 
 
 Purpose 
 
 We are entrusted with a great deal of sensitive information at Ciena. Our goal is to ensure that access to this information is used to perform our jobs, understand our business and financial performance and promote our strategy. Our culture thrives on this sense of a shared mission and we intend to keep it that way. 
 
 Because of the degree of transparency necessary to achieve this collective understanding, we must be mindful about how we treat and use information that we receive during our work for Ciena. It is illegal to buy or sell securities when one is in possession of material, non-public information about that company conduct known as insider trading. It is also illegal to tip or pass on material, non-public information to someone who may buy or sell securities. 
 
 This purpose of this Insider Trading Policy is to 
 
 Clarify which persons and what activities are covered by the Policy 
 Prohibit insider trading, tipping and certain speculative transactions 
 Define material, non-public information and establish rules of behavior when possessing it and 
 Protect Ciena s reputation for integrity and ethical conduct. 
 
 Who Is Covered 
 
 This Policy applies to officers, directors and all employees, temporary employees, consultants or contractors of Ciena Corporation and its subsidiaries Ciena or the Company (collectively, Covered Persons regardless of whether or not they are also Access Persons subject to the trading window described below. 
 
 This Policy also applies to any spouse, partner, minor children and other persons sharing the same household with any Covered Person and entities that a Covered Person directly or indirectly influences or controls (collectively, Related Persons ). 
 
 What Activities Are Covered 
 
 This Policy applies to transactions in securities including 
 
 Ciena common stock, restricted stock units, stock options, debt securities and other securities Ciena may issue from time to time Ciena Securities and 

securities that are exercisable or exchangeable into Ciena Securities, whether or not issued by Ciena, including market-traded put or call options. 
 
 This Policy also applies to transactions in securities of third party business partners when possessing material, non-public information about them obtained in the course of work for Ciena. 
 
 Insider Trading and Tipping Are Prohibited 
 
 While in possession of material, non-public information relating to Ciena, Covered Persons are prohibited from 
 
 buying, selling or engaging in any transaction, directly or indirectly, involving Ciena Securities 
 making recommendations or expressing opinions about trading in Ciena Securities based on that information 
 disclosing or tipping that information to any person, including Related Persons, publicly or privately, verbally or in writing, electronically or otherwise, including by posting such information to any web-based or social media platform or providing it to a third-party information broker 
 otherwise engaging in any other action to take personal advantage of such information or 
 assisting anyone in the above activities. 
 
 Covered Persons are required to abstain from the above transactions until the material, non-public information is publicly disclosed or ceases to be material. Although mandatory, automatic sales pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 transaction, stock options exercises or purchases through Ciena s Employee Stock Purchase Plan are exempt from these prohibitions, the sale of any such shares in the market is still prohibited. 
 
 Customers, Suppliers or Other Business Partners 
 
 Covered Persons who obtain material, non-public information about another company in the course of work for Ciena are subject to the same prohibitions described above with respect to the securities of that company. Covered Persons should treat material, non-public information about Ciena s customers, suppliers and other business partners with the same degree of care required with respect to Ciena s information. 
 
 Material, Non-Public Information 
 
 In general, material information is any information that a reasonable investor would consider important in a decision to buy, hold or sell securities. Any information, positive or negative, that could reasonably affect the price of a company s stock is by its nature material. 

It is not possible to define all categories of material information because it depends upon the relevant facts and circumstances. Information that is material or immaterial at one point in time may cease to be so at another point in time. However, non-public information about the following items is often considered to be material 
 
 quarterly or annual financial results or projections 
 a pending or proposed acquisition, merger or similar strategic initiative 
 an offering of equity or debt securities 
 changes in senior management 
 significant new product or technology developments 
 changes in our stock repurchase program, or the issuance of a stock dividend or split 
 gain or loss of a substantial customer, supplier, or strategic partner 
 a significant cybersecurity incident involving our business or products 
 litigation, whether pending or threatened, or inquiry by governmental agencies or positive or negative developments in existing litigation or investigations 
 other similar information likely to have a significant impact on our financial results or stock price. 
 
 In general, information is considered non-public until it has been disclosed broadly to the market (for example, in a press release or a filing with the SEC) and the investing public has had time to absorb fully the information typically at the start of the third trading day after such information is released. A trading day is a day on which the New York Stock Exchange is open for business 
 
 Ciena s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and General Counsel are authorized to determine whether any information constitutes material, non-public information. 
 
 Proper Handling of Information 
 
 Under Ciena s C ode of Business Conduct and Ethics, Covered Persons are responsible for protecting confidential information related to Ciena s business. Information about Ciena or its customers, suppliers or other business partners obtained in the course of work for Ciena may only be used for legitimate business purposes. Questions about the appropriate use of confidential information or what constitutes a legitimate business purpose may be directed to the Legal Department. 
 
 To ensure that information is protected from leaks or premature disclosure and that it is disclosed in a manner that does not favor certain investors over others, only Ciena s specifically authorized personnel may release material information to the public or respond to inquiries from the media, analysts or others outside Ciena. Ciena s Corporate Disclosure Policy sets forth the Company s established procedures as to who may disclose such information and under what circumstances. Unauthorized disclosure of such information to anyone outside the Company is prohibited. 

Additional Prohibited Transactions 
 
 Short-term or speculative transactions in Ciena Securities can create an actual or perceived misalignment with the interest of our stockholders. Accordingly, Covered Persons and Related Persons, whether or not in possession of material, non-public information, are prohibited from engaging in the following transactions with respect to Ciena Securities 
 
 Short sales 
 Trading in market-traded options, including market-traded put and call options and 
 Hedging or monetization transactions, including zero-cost collars and forward sale contracts. 
 
 No Margin Accounts or Pledging Ciena Securities 
 
 Covered Persons are prohibited from holding Ciena Securities in a margin account or pledging Ciena Securities as collateral for a loan, because the underlying stock may be sold in the event of failure to meet a margin call or a loan default and at a time when the pledger is aware of material, non-public information or otherwise is not permitted to trade in Ciena Securities. Exceptions may be granted where a Covered Person wishes to pledge Ciena Securities as collateral for a loan (not including margin debt) and can clearly demonstrate the financial capacity to repay the loan. Requests for such approval, together with the relevant pledge documents, must be provided to the General Counsel at least two weeks prior to the proposed transaction. 
 
 Consequences of Violations 
 
 The penalties for violating the insider trading laws can be severe for individuals involved in the unlawful conduct and their employers and supervisors. Individuals who engage in insider trading may be subject to forfeiture of their profits, civil penalties of up to three times the profit gained or loss avoided, criminal fines of up to 5 million (no matter how small the profit) and jail sentences of up to 20 years. The SEC frequently obtains substantial penalties from persons who did nothing more than pass along material, non-public information to others who trade in the stock. An individual who communicates or tips inside information to another person who then trades is subject to the same penalties as the tippee who trades on that information, even if the employee did not trade or profit from the trading. 
 
 Covered Persons who violate this Policy may be subject to disciplinary action, including immediate termination of employment for cause or the termination of such other business relationship with Ciena, whether or not the failure to comply with this Policy results in a violation of law. 

Access Persons May Not Trade When Window is Closed 
 
 The trading window is an additional requirement that applies to Ciena s directors, executive officers and certain other specified employees who have or are likely to have regular access to Ciena s material, non-public information, including with respect to its financial results (collectively, Access Persons ). The General Counsel will determine the list of Access Persons from time to time. 
 
 The announcement of quarterly financial results and forward-looking guidance can have a material effect on the trading price of Ciena Securities. To protect against allegations and to avoid even the appearance of insider trading, Access Persons are prohibited from buying or selling Ciena Securities in the open market when the trading window is closed. 
 
 The trading window generally closes on the fifteenth day of the last month of each fiscal quarter, and generally reopens on the third trading day after Ciena has published its earnings release for that quarter (e.g., if Ciena announces earnings on a Thursday, the window would reopen on the following Monday). The General Counsel will notify Access Persons of the opening and closing of the trading window however, all Access Persons are expected to know these basic window mechanics. 
 
 Ciena may also close the trading window at other times, including for Access Persons or other groups of employees who may be in possession of Ciena s material, non-public information as a result of their work on or awareness of a pending initiative, transaction or announcement. 
 
 The trading window restrictions will not apply to transactions in Ciena Securities effected pursuant to an authorized Rule 10b5-1 trading plan that is in compliance with Ciena s requirements. Please refer to Ciena s 10b5-1 Plan Guidelines (the 10b5-1 Policy for additional details on authorized Rule 10b5-1 trading plans, including the requirements for cooling-off periods and timing of initial trades under authorized Rule 10b5-1 trading plans, as well as certain limitations and expectations. 
 
 Pre-Clearance of Trades by Directors and Executive Officers 
 
 The Board of Directors and certain designated executive officers (collectively, Reporting Persons are subject to additional requirements under applicable securities laws, including Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Section 16 ). Section 16 requires disclosure of holdings and transactions in Ciena Securities by Reporting Persons, members of their immediate families, and certain trusts or other entities in which the insider holds a beneficial interest. Section 16 also provides for disgorgement of short-swing profits gained by Reporting Persons. Accordingly, Reporting Persons are required to notify the General Counsel or their designee and pre-clear any proposed transaction in Ciena Securities in advance of executing such transaction. Any such pre-clearance will be valid for two trading days and, if the transaction is not completed within that timeframe, pre-clearance must be requested 

again. If the Reporting Person becomes aware of any material, non-public information after requesting pre-clearance but before the transaction has been effected, the Reporting Person may not proceed with the transaction. The purpose of these pre-clearance procedures is to ensure timely reporting, prevent inadvertent violations of the federal securities laws and avoid even the appearance of trading on inside information. 
 
 Additionally, Reporting Persons must notify the General Counsel or their designee and pre-clear any proposed gifts of Ciena equity securities. Completed gifts made by Reporting Persons must also be promptly reported to Ciena s Legal Department, as these gifts must be reported on Form 4 before the end of the second business day following the date of execution of the transaction. This includes, for example, certain estate planning transactions such as gifts of Ciena equity securities among trusts established by a Reporting Person. 
 
 Further Information and Getting Assistance 
 
 Transactions in Ciena Securities by Covered Persons and Related Persons will be viewed after-the-fact with the benefit of hindsight. As a result, before engaging in any transaction, Covered Persons should carefully consider how regulatory authorities and others might view the transaction in light of subsequent developments. Exercising strong judgment is paramount. To prevent inadvertent violations and avoid even the appearance of an improper transaction, Covered Persons are advised to seek additional guidance from the Legal Department before engaging in any transaction in securities covered by this Policy. 
 
 Post-Termination Transactions 
 
 This Policy and its prohibitions continue to apply to transactions in Ciena Securities after an individual is no longer employed by or associated or affiliated with Ciena. Accordingly, Covered Persons who are in possession of material, non-public information at the time of termination of their employment or association or affiliation with Ciena are prohibited from trading in Ciena Securities until that information is publicly disclosed or ceases to be material. 
 
 Acknowledgment and Certification 
 
 Employees are required to certify their receipt and understanding of this Policy at the time they join Ciena and on an ongoing basis as part of the periodic affirmation and acknowledgement of Ciena s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics.
