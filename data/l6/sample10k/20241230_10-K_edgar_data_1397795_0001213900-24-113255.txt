The Company has no operations
or revenue as of the date of this Report. We are currently in the process of developing a business plan. Management intends to explore
and identify viable business opportunities within the U.S. including seeking to acquire a business in a reverse merger. Our ability to
effectively identify, develop and implement a viable plan for our business may be hindered by risks and uncertainties which are beyond
our control, including without limitation, the continued negative effects of the coronavirus pandemic on the U.S. and global economies.
For more information about the risk of Covid-19 on our business, see Item 1A Risk Factors. 

Plan of Operation 

The Company has no operations
from a continuing business other than the expenditures related to running the Company and has no revenue from continuing operations as
of the date of this Report. 

Management intends to
explore and identify business opportunities within the U.S., including a potential acquisition of an operating entity through a reverse
merger, asset purchase, or similar transaction. Our Chief Executive Officer has experience in business consulting, although no assurances
can be given that he can identify and implement a viable business strategy or that any such strategy will result in profits. Our ability
to effectively identify, develop and implement a viable plan for our business may be hindered by risks and uncertainties which are beyond
our control, including without limitation, the continued negative effects of the coronavirus pandemic on the U.S. and global economies.
For more information about the risk of coronavirus on our business, see Item 1A Risk Factors. 

We do not currently engage
in any business activities that provide revenue or cash flow. During the next 12-month period we anticipate incurring costs in connection
with investigating, evaluating, and negotiating potential business combinations, filing SEC reports, and consummating an acquisition of
an operating business. 

5 

Given our limited capital
resources, we may consider a business combination with an entity which has recently commenced operations, is a developing company or is
otherwise in need of additional funds for the development of new products or services or expansion into new markets, or is an established
business experiencing financial or operating difficulties and is in need of additional capital. Alternatively, a business combination
may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, an entity which desires access to the U.S. capital markets. 

As of the date of this
Report, our management has not had any discussions with any representative of any other entity regarding a potential business combination.
Any target business that is selected may be financially unstable or in the early stages of development. In such event, we expect to be
subject to numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of a financially unstable or early-stage entity. In addition, we may
effect a business combination with an entity in an industry characterized by a high level of risk or in which our management has limited
experience, and, although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, there can be no
assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risks. 

Our management anticipates
that we will likely only be able to effect one business combination due to our limited capital. This lack of diversification will likely
pose a substantial risk in investing in the Company for the indefinite future because it will not permit us to offset potential losses
from one venture or operating territory against gains from another. The risks we face will likely be heightened to the extent we acquire
a business operating in a single industry or geographical region. 

We anticipate that the
selection of a business combination will be a complex and risk-prone process. Because of general economic conditions, including unfavorable
conditions caused by the coronavirus pandemic, rapid technological advances being made in some industries and shortages of available capital,
management believes that there are a number of firms seeking business opportunities at this time at discounted rates with which we will
compete. We expect that any potentially available business combinations may appear in a variety of different industries or regions and
at various stages of development, all of which will likely render the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business
opportunities extremely difficult and complicated. Once we have developed and begun to implement our business plan, management intends
to fund our working capital requirements through a combination of our existing funds and future issuances of debt or equity securities.
Our working capital requirements are expected to increase in line with the implementation of a business plan and commencement of operations. 

Based upon our current
operations, we do not have sufficient working capital to fund our operations over the next 12 months. If we are able to close a reverse
merger, it is likely we will need capital as a condition of closing that acquisition. Because of the uncertainties, we cannot be certain
as to how much capital we need to raise or the type of securities we will be required to issue. In connection with a reverse merger, we
will be required to issue a controlling block of our securities to the target s shareholders which will be very dilutive. 

Additional issuances
of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might have rights,
preferences, or privileges senior to our Common Stock. Additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate
funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors
or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations. 

We anticipate that we
will incur operating losses in the next 12 months, principally costs related to our being obligated to file reports with the SEC. Our
prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stage
of development. Such risks for us include, but are not limited to, an evolving and unpredictable business model, recognition of revenue
sources, and the management of growth. To address these risks, we must, among other things, develop, implement, and successfully execute
our business and marketing strategy, respond to competitive developments, and attract, retain, and motivate qualified personnel. There
can be no assurance that we will be successful in addressing such risks, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect
on our business prospects, financial condition, and results of operations. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements
that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues
or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources that are material to investors. 

Going Concern 

The independent registered
public accounting firm auditors report accompanying our December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 financial statements contained
an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements have
been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates that we will realize our assets and
satisfy our liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting
Firm 

To the shareholders and the board of directors
of Born, Inc f/k/a Quture International, Inc. 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Born, Inc. as of
December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related statements of operations, stockholders (deficit), and cash flows for the years then ended,
and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations
and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. 

Substantial Doubt about the Company s
Ability to Continue as a Going Concern 

The accompanying financial statements have been
prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has
suffered recurring losses from operations and has a significant accumulated deficit. In addition, the Company continues to experience
negative cash flows from operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.
Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments
that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our
audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged
to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audit included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond
to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matters 

The critical audit matters communicated below
are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to
the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our
especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion
on the financial statements, taken as a whole 10 , and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing
separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 

No matters identified in the audit were considered
to be critical audit matters.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our
management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, have evaluated the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this Report. 

These controls are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and that such information
is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Based on this evaluation, our management, including
our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective
as of December 31, 2021. 

We believe that our financial statements presented
in this annual report on Form 10-K fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows
for all periods presented herein. 

Inherent Limitations Our
management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and
procedures will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable,
not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. The design of any system of controls is based in part upon
certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its
stated goals under all potential future conditions. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource
constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control
systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company
have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdown
can occur because of simple error or mistake. In particular, many of our current processes rely upon manual reviews and processes to ensure
that neither human error nor system weakness has resulted in erroneous reporting of financial data. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our fourth fiscal quarter that
have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

This Annual Report does not include an attestation
report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not
subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission
that permit us to provide only management s report in this Annual Report.

Management Report on Internal
Control over Financial Reporting 

Our management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange
Act. Those rules define internal control over financial reporting as a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that: 

Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and the receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and 

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisitions, use or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal
controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria established in Internal
Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) 2013. 

Based on its assessment, management has concluded
that as of December 31, 2021, our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting were effective. 

This Annual Report does not include an attestation
report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not
subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission
that permit us to provide only management s report in this Annual Report.

Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial
Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters. 

The following table sets forth, as of December
31, 2021 certain information with respect to the beneficial ownership of our common shares by each shareholder known by us to be the beneficial
owner of more than 5 of our common shares, as well as by each of our current Directors and Executive Officers as a group. Each person
has sole voting and investment power with respect to the shares of Common Stock, except as otherwise indicated. Beneficial ownership consists
of a direct interest in the shares of Common Stock, except as otherwise indicated. 

Under Rule 13d-3, a beneficial owner of a security
includes any person who, directly or indirectly, through any contract, arrangement, understanding, relationship, or otherwise has or shares:
(i) voting power, which includes the power to vote, or to direct the voting of shares; and (ii) investment power, which includes the power
to dispose or direct the disposition of shares. Certain shares may be deemed to be beneficially owned by more than one person (if, for
example, persons share the power to vote or the power to dispose of the shares). In addition, shares are deemed to be beneficially owned
by a person if the person has the right to acquire the shares (for example, upon exercise of an option) within 60 days of the date as
of which the information is provided. In computing the percentage ownership of any person, the amount of shares outstanding is deemed
to include the amount of shares beneficially owned by such person (and only such person) by reason of these acquisition rights. As a result,
the percentage of outstanding shares of any person as shown in this table does not necessarily reflect the person s actual ownership
or voting power with respect to the number of shares of Common Stock actually outstanding on December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021,
there were 419,984,423 of our company s Common Stock issued and outstanding.
