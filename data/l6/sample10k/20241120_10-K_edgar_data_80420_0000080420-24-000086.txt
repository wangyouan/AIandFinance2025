PART I 

Item 1. Business 
 Overview 
 Powell Industries, Inc. is a Delaware corporation founded by William E. Powell in 1947. We develop, design, manufacture and service custom-engineered equipment and systems that distribute, control and monitor the flow of electrical energy and provide protection to motors, transformers and other electrically powered equipment. Our major subsidiaries, all of which are wholly owned, include Powell Electrical Systems, Inc.; Powell Canada, Inc.; Powell (UK) Limited; and Powell Industries International, B.V. 
 We are headquartered in Houston, Texas, and primarily serve the oil and gas and petrochemical markets, the electric utility market, and commercial and other industrial markets. Beyond these major markets, we also provide products and services to the light rail traction power market and other markets that include universities and government entities. We are continuously developing new channels to electrical markets through original equipment manufacturers and distribution market channels. 
 Our website is powellind.com . We make available, free of charge on or through our website, electronic copies of our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports, filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as soon as is reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC. Additionally, all of our reports filed with the SEC are available via their website at sec.gov . 
 References to Fiscal 2024, Fiscal 2023 and Fiscal 2022 used throughout this Annual Report relate to our fiscal years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
 Products and Services 
 Our principal products include integrated power control room substations (PCRs ), custom-engineered modules, electrical houses (E-Houses), traditional and arc-resistant distribution switchgear and control gear, medium-voltage circuit breakers, monitoring and control communications systems, motor control centers, switches and bus duct systems. These products are designed for application voltages ranging from 480 volts to 38,000 volts. Our product scope includes designs tested to meet both United States (U.S.) and international standards, under both the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). We also provide spare parts, retrofit and retrofill components for existing systems, and replacement circuit breakers for obsolete switchgear no longer produced by the original manufacturer. Our principal services include field service inspection, installation, commissioning, modification and repair services. 
 Products and services are principally sold directly to the end user or to an engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) firm on behalf of the end user. Each project is specifically engineered and manufactured to meet the exact specifications and requirements of the individual customer. Powell s expertise is in the design, engineering, manufacturing, project management and integration of assorted systems into a single, custom-engineered deliverable. We market and sell our products and services, which are typically awarded in competitive bid situations, to a wide variety of customers and governmental agencies spanning diverse markets and geographic regions. 
 Occasionally, our contracts may operate under a consortium or teaming arrangement. Typically, we enter into these arrangements with reputable companies with whom we have previously conducted business. These arrangements are generally made to leverage competitive positioning, or where scale or size dictates the use of such arrangement. 
 We seek to establish long-term relationships with the end users of our systems as well as EPC firms contracted by those end users. We believe that fostering a culture of safety and focusing on customer satisfaction, along with our strong balance sheet, allows us to capitalize on opportunities in the industries we serve. 
 4 

Due to the nature and timing of large projects, a significant percentage of our revenues in a given period may result from one specific contract or customer. Contracts often represent large-scale and complex projects with an individual customer. By their nature, these projects are typically non-recurring. Thus, multiple or continuous projects of similar magnitude with the same customer are not predictable. The timing of large project awards may cause material fluctuations in our revenues and gross profits. Additionally, the reduction in business volume from a particular industry or the loss of a major customer could have an adverse effect on our business. From time to time, an individual manufacturing facility may have significant volume from one particular customer that would be material to that facility. If during that time the customer were to experience financial distress, a decline in business or circumstances that would otherwise necessitate a cancellation of a project with us, our revenue could be adversely impacted. In both Fiscal 2024 and Fiscal 2023, no single customer accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated revenues. 
 Research, Development and Intellectual Property 
 Research and development activities are critical to Powell s sustained growth and are focused on both the development of new products and applications and enhancement of our existing product offerings. For example, Powell's expertise in vacuum circuit breaker engineering is internationally recognized, and leveraging this expertise in the development of new products will help us expand into a broader range of application spaces and industry sectors. We are committed to continuous product improvement that will positively impact operational safety and reliability across the markets we serve. 
 From time to time, we apply for patents on new inventions and designs, but we believe that the growth of our business will depend primarily upon the quality of our products and our relationships with our customers, rather than the extent of our patent protection. 
 Additionally, we may acquire from time to time intellectual property to expand our product offering and application. For example, in December 2023, we acquired intellectual property for a total consideration of 0.5 million. Intellectual property not covered by patents (or patent applications) includes trade secrets and other technological know-how that is not patentable or for which we have elected not to seek patent protection, including intellectual property relating to our manufacturing processes and engineering designs. Such unpatented technology, including research, development and engineering technical skills and know-how, as well as unpatented software, is important to our overall business and to the operations of our business. While our intellectual property assets taken together are important, we do not believe our business would be materially affected by the expiration of any particular intellectual property right or termination of any particular intellectual property patent license agreement. 
 Markets 
 While we provide products and services to a wide range of markets where customers need to manage, monitor and control large amounts of electrical energy, demand for our products and services is driven predominantly by the oil and gas, petrochemical, electric utility, and commercial and other industrial markets. The majority of our business is in support of capital investment projects that are highly complex and competitively bid. Our customized systems are designed to meet the specifications of our customers. Each system is designed, engineered and manufactured to the specific requirements of the particular application. We consider our engineering, project management, systems integration and technical support capabilities vital to the success of our business. We strive to develop strong and lasting relationships with our customers and are recognized by many as a preferred service provider to solve our customers complex electrical distribution needs. 
 The following table presents our revenue for each market sector by percentage of total revenue for the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022: 
 2024 2023 2022 Oil and gas (excluding petrochemical) 41 39 40 Petrochemical 18 13 13 Electric utility 19 23 23 Commercial and other industrial 15 15 11 Light rail traction power 2 4 8 All others 5 6 5 Total 100 100 100

In the oil and gas markets, we serve the upstream, midstream and downstream end markets, including onshore and offshore production, liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities and terminals, pipelines and refineries. In addition to the traditional crude oil refining and other oil and gas downstream processes, we have recently expanded our end markets into hydrogen production, carbon capture, as well as alternative fuels, such as biofuels and sustainable aviation fuel, in response to the demand for clean energy. 
 Within the petrochemical market, our primary customers typically are engaged in leveraging hydrocarbon or natural gas feedstocks for the production of petrochemical, or oil- or gas-to-chemical products, including polyethylene, polypropylene, fertilizer, methanol, and related petrochemical applications. 
 In the electric utility market, we serve both the power generation and distribution end markets. Increasing global electricity demand and the focus on reliable and safe electrical distribution are driving substantial investments in global infrastructure. Aligned with our strategy of end-market diversification, we seek to continue our focus and growth in electrical distribution substations, while also addressing a resurgence of power generation investment in the market. 
 In the commercial and other industrial markets, our customers operate in commercial construction, data centers, metals and mining, pulp and paper, as well as other industrial applications. 
 Beyond these major markets, we also provide products and services to the light rail traction power market and other markets that include universities and government entities. We are continuously developing new channels to electrical markets through original equipment manufacturers and distribution market channels. 
 Competition 
 We compete with a small number of multinational competitors that sell to a broad industrial and geographic market, as well as smaller, regional competitors that typically have limited capabilities and scope of supply. We believe that our products and services, integration capabilities, technical and project management acumen, application engineering expertise and specialty contracting experience, together with our financial strength and responsiveness to the needs of our customers, give us a sustainable competitive advantage in our markets. Some of our competitors are significantly larger and have substantially greater global resources such as engineering, manufacturing and marketing. Our principal competitors include ABB, Eaton, Schneider, and Siemens Industries, Inc. The competitive factors used during bid evaluation by our customers vary from project to project and may include technical support and application expertise, engineering and manufacturing capabilities, equipment rating, delivered value, scheduling and price. While projects are typically non-recurring, a significant portion of our business is from repeat customers and many times involves third-party EPC firms hired by the end user and with whom we often have long, established relationships. Ultimately, our competitive position is dependent upon our ability to provide quality custom-engineered products, services and systems on a timely basis at a competitive price. 
 Backlog 
 Backlog represents management's estimate of the remaining unsatisfied performance obligation from work to be performed on our firm orders under uncompleted contracts and customer purchase orders, including approved change orders as well as new contractual agreements on which work has not begun. Our backlog will be recognized as revenue as we complete the remaining performance obligations. Our backlog does not include service and maintenance-type contracts for which we have the right to invoice as services are performed. Typically, our contracts may have an early termination for convenience clause at the discretion of our customers; however, most of these contracts typically provide for the reimbursement of our costs incurred and a reasonable margin in the event of such early termination. Our methodology for determining backlog may not be comparable to the methodology used by other companies. 
 Our backlog at September 30, 2024 was 1.3 billion. We anticipate that approximately 849 million of Fiscal 2024 ending backlog will be recognized as revenue during our fiscal year ending September 30, 2025. Backlog may not be indicative of future operating results as orders may be cancelled or modified by our customers and may not be indicative of continuing revenue performance over future fiscal quarters. 
 Raw Materials 
 The principal raw materials used in our operations include steel, copper and aluminum, as well as various engineered electrical components. Material costs represented 47 of revenues in Fiscal 2024, 49 of revenues in Fiscal 2023, and 51 of revenues in Fiscal 2022. Unanticipated changes in material requirements, market conditions and disruptions in the supply chain or price increases could impact production costs and affect our consolidated results of operations. 
 6 

The equipment and materials that we use in our business are subject to availability and price fluctuations due to customer demand, producer capacity and market conditions. Uncertainty and fluctuating global demand have led to significant volatility across commodity markets. We have experienced supply chain disruptions driven predominately by availability and cost volatility across our raw materials, engineered components and labor force. As our procurement function seeks to address specific supply chain challenges, we are working closely with our suppliers to meet our customer commitments. While we have experienced, and may continue to experience, issues related to increased lead times for the purchase and delivery of key raw materials or components, we continue to monitor the availability (including transportation) and price of components and raw materials on a regular basis, as well as any potential impact on our operations. In response to the increased cost environment and supply chain challenges, we strive to effectively manage our product pricing, delivery schedules and bid validity dates with our customers, as well as improve factory efficiencies and project execution. While the cost outlook for commodities used in the production of our products is not certain, we believe we can manage this volatility through contract pricing adjustments, with material-cost predictive estimating, hedging and by actively pursuing internal cost reduction efforts. 
 Our supply base for certain key components and raw materials is limited. Many of our products require raw materials and components supplied by a limited number of suppliers, and in some instances, a single supplier. Changes in our design to accommodate similar components from other suppliers could be implemented to resolve a supply problem related to a sole-sourced component. Supply problems could result in delays in our ability to meet commitments to our customers and potentially result in liquidated damages assessed by our customers. We believe that sources of supply for raw materials and components are generally sufficient, and we do not believe a temporary shortage of materials will cause any significant adverse impact to our business and results of operations in the future. 
 Human Capital 
 At September 30, 2024, we had 2,748 full-time employees and 439 contract employees located primarily in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom (U.K.). Our employees are not represented by unions, and we maintain good relationships with our employees. Periodically, we find it challenging to source qualified personnel in certain geographic areas due to increased construction or economic activity. We continue to monitor our demand for skilled and unskilled labor and provide training and competitive compensation packages in an effort to attract and retain skilled employees. A decline in our employee relations, labor shortages or increased labor costs could impair our ability to maintain our business, meet customer commitments or grow our revenues, and may adversely impact our business and results of operations. 
 Our top human capital priorities include the well-being, health and safety, and retention of our employees, as well as enhanced learning and leadership training opportunities, workplace safety, internal promotion and key employee retention. We emphasize a culture of safety that runs throughout the Company. We establish annual goals and monthly operating metrics and, as a result, had a safety incident rate of 0.74 for Fiscal Year 2024, which is below the industry average, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. We believe that the eight-year average tenure of our employees is a reflection of our inclusive and supportive culture, focused efforts on internal promotion, key employee retention and succession planning. Our annual Organizational Capabilities Review is focused on succession planning within our organization and is reviewed annually by our Board of Directors. We measure our success based on the percentage of internal promotions to key positions and our ability to attract and retain key employees. 
 Seasonality 
 Our operations are not generally affected by seasonality. However, weather and natural phenomena can temporarily impact the performance of our operations. Furthermore, quarterly operating results may fluctuate in our first fiscal quarter due to the reduction in the number of workdays related to the number of holidays and paid time off that is taken in that fiscal quarter. 
 Government Regulations 
 We are subject to various government regulations in the U.S. as well as various international locations where we operate. These regulations cover diverse areas including environmental compliance, import and export controls, economic sanctions, data and privacy protection, transfer pricing rules, anti-bribery, anti-trafficking and anti-trust provisions. Our policies mandate compliance with applicable laws and regulations administered by various state, federal and international agencies, and are designed to promote and encourage ethical practices in our everyday operations. We have established a multi-faceted compliance program that includes educating employees and leadership, performing risk-based due diligence and evaluating our supplier base. We believe that the compliance cost associated with these governmental regulations will not have a material impact on our capital expenditures, results of operations or competitive position.

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 Our business is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties described below. If any of the following risks occur, the business s financial condition, cash flows, liquidity and results of operations may be negatively impacted, and we may not be able to achieve our quarterly, annual or long-range plans. Additional risks and uncertainties not known to us or not described below may also negatively impact our business and results of operations. This Annual Report also includes statements reflecting assumptions, expectations, projections, intentions or beliefs about future events that are intended as forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and should be read in conjunction with the discussion under Forward-Looking Statements above. 
 Risk Factors Related to our Business and Industry 
 Our business is subject to the cyclical nature of the end markets that we serve. This cyclicality has had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on our operating results. 
 The end markets that we serve have historically been cyclical and will continue to be vulnerable to general downturns, which in turn could materially and adversely affect the demand for our products and services. Our customer projects, budgets for capital expenditures and the need for our services have in the past, and may in the future, be adversely affected by, among other things, the price of oil and gas, poor economic conditions, commodity prices, political uncertainties, cost of capital, and currency fluctuations. These variables may impact the number or the amount of new awards, delays in the timing of awards or potential cancellation of projects. Changes in product mix or services can have a significant impact on our gross margins on a quarterly and annual basis. The uncertainty of our contract award timing is outside of our control and can also present difficulties in matching workforce size with contract requirements. In some cases, we bear and maintain the cost of a ready workforce that may be larger than necessary in anticipation of future workforce needs. If an expected contract is delayed or not received, we may incur additional costs in staff or facility redundancy that could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our industry is highly competitive. 
 Some of our competitors are significantly larger and have substantially greater global resources such as engineering, manufacturing and marketing resources, and at various times, may be our customer or supplier on any given project. Competition in the industry depends on a number of factors, including the number of projects available, technical ability, production capacity, production lead times, location and the ability to win projects we bid. Certain of our competitors may have lower cost structures or a more favorable geographic footprint and may, therefore, be able to provide their products or services at lower prices. Similarly, we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain or enhance our competitive position within our industry, maintain our customer base at current levels, increase our customer base or continue to provide technologically superior products at a competitive price. New companies may enter the markets in which we compete, or industry consolidation may occur, further increasing competition in our markets. Our failure to compete effectively and secure projects could adversely affect future revenues and could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations. 
 Our backlog is subject to unexpected adjustments, cancellations and scope reductions and, therefore, may not be a reliable indicator of our future earnings. 
 We have a backlog of uncompleted contracts. Backlog represents management s best estimate of the remaining performance obligation from work to be performed on our firm orders under uncompleted contracts and customer purchase orders, including approved change orders as well as new contractual agreements on which work has not begun. From time to time, projects are cancelled, delayed or modified due to customer, industry or macroeconomic conditions. While we may be reimbursed for certain costs, we may not have a contractual right to the total revenue reflected in our backlog. The ultimate realization of the future revenue in our backlog is based upon our ability to complete the contracted projects, and we cannot control all of the various factors that might impact the timely delivery of our projects to our customers. We may be unable to recover certain costs on our anticipated margin, and cancelled or suspended projects may also result in additional unrecoverable costs due to the underutilization of our assets and personnel. Accordingly, our inability to realize the full amount of our contract backlog may have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations. 
 8 

Failure to place competitive bids and adequately project costs may result in losses on our fixed-price contracts with customers. 
 Our products and services are typically awarded in competitive bid situations. When placing bids, we may fail to adequately project costs for our customers projects, which may lead to us winning a bid that does not adequately compensate us for our costs. Such failure could adversely impact our results of operations. Factors that could impact our ability to adequately project costs for our bids include, but are not limited to: the impacts of inflation; labor shortage; delays incurred by the failure of third-party suppliers to deliver in the quality or quantity required; unanticipated technical problems, including design or engineering issues. Additionally, we bear the risk of cost overruns and delays in most of our contracts and, as a result, if we fail to adequately manage such cost overruns or delays, our results of operations and our business may be adversely impacted. 
 Supplier concentration and limited supplier capacity may adversely impact our business and results of operations. 
 We rely on a limited number of suppliers for certain of our components and raw materials and, in some instances, a single supplier. Switching suppliers can be costly and disruptive to business operations. If one or more of our suppliers or subcontractors experiences difficulties that result in a reduction, delay or interruption in supply to us, or they fail to meet our manufacturing requirements, our business could be adversely impacted, and we may incur liquidated damages until we are able to secure alternative sources. Our suppliers may experience and some of our suppliers have experienced financial difficulties, delivery delays and other performance problems, which may cause us to incur additional costs or be unable to meet commitments to our customers. The time and effort associated with the selection and qualification of a new supplier and changes in our design and testing to accommodate similar components from other suppliers could be significant. In any such event, we may not be able to contract for and receive suitable alternative supply or manufacturing abilities in a timely manner for our customers, if at all, which may impair our ability to meet scheduled deliveries of our products to customers and adversely impact our business and results of operations. 
 Our business requires skilled and unskilled labor, and we may be unable to attract and retain qualified employees. 
 Our ability to maintain our productivity at competitive levels may be limited by our ability to employ, compensate, train and retain personnel necessary to meet our requirements. We face competition within and outside of our markets for qualified personnel across all of our workforce. We may experience shortages of qualified personnel such as engineers, project managers, supervisors, office personnel and select skilled trades. We cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain an adequate skilled or unskilled labor force or key technical personnel necessary to operate efficiently and to support our growth strategy and operations. We cannot be certain that our labor costs will not increase as a result of a shortage in the supply of skilled, unskilled and technical personnel or any governmental regulations. Labor shortages or increased labor costs could impair our ability to maintain our business, meet customer commitments or grow our revenues, and could adversely impact our business and results of operations. 
 Revenues recognized over time from our fixed-price contracts could result in volatility in our results of operations. 
 As discussed in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Estimates and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report, the majority of our revenues are recognized over time. Since revenue is recognized as work is performed and as costs are incurred, the determination of the revenue recognized requires the use of estimates of costs to be incurred for the performance of the contract. Estimates of revenue and of costs to complete are adjusted based on ongoing reviews of estimated contract performance, and previously recorded estimates of revenues and costs are adjusted as the project progresses and circumstances change. The timing of the costs incurred may lead to fluctuations in revenue recognized on a quarterly and annual basis, which could have an adverse impact on our business and our results of operations. While the cost estimation process is based upon the professional knowledge and experience of our management teams, engineers, project managers and financial professionals, we may fail to adequately estimate our costs or revenue (or, we may fail to adequately adjust previously recorded estimates of revenue and costs). Such failure could result in additional changes to our revenue and cost estimates which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.

We are exposed to risks relating to the use of subcontractors. 
 We hire subcontractors to perform work on some projects and may depend on third-party labor suppliers to provide the personnel necessary to engineer, manufacture and ship our products. If our subcontractors do not perform as expected for any reason, we may experience delays in completing our projects or incur additional costs. In addition, we may have disputes with these independent subcontractors arising from, among other things, the price, quality or timeliness of the work performed. Some of the third parties we engage in support of our operations operate internationally, and thus we may be impacted by the economic, political and labor conditions in those regions as well as uncertainty caused by international relations issues between the United States and those countries. Any of these factors could adversely impact our business and results of operations. 
 Technological innovations may make existing products and production methods obsolete. 
 All of the products that we manufacture and sell depend upon optimizing available technology for success in the marketplace. The industries in which we operate are characterized by intense competition and are highly sensitive to technological innovation and customer requirements. Our competitors may develop products or production methods that are superior in price or quality, or incorporate artificial intelligence (AI) into their products that will make current products or services offered by us obsolete. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and offer products that meet changing industry and customer specifications, including by funding our research and development costs. For example, consumer demand for further automation is changing the markets in which we operate. Failure to successfully develop new products, or to enhance existing products, could result in the loss of existing customers to competitors, the inability to attract new business or an overall reduction of our competitive position, any of which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. 
 We may not be successful in our AI initiatives, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, and results of operations. 
 The algorithms and models utilized in generative AI systems may have limitations, including biases, errors, or inability to handle certain data types or scenarios. Furthermore, there is a risk of system failures, disruptions, or vulnerabilities that could compromise the integrity, security, or privacy of the generated content. These limitations or failures could result in reputational damage, legal liabilities, or loss of customer/user confidence. Cybersecurity threats and the techniques used in cyberattacks change, develop and evolve rapidly, including from emerging technologies, such as advanced forms of AI and quantum computing. Because AI technology is highly complex and rapidly developing, it is not possible to predict all of the legal, operational or technological risks that may arise relating to our use of AI. 
 Unforeseen difficulties with expansions, relocations, or consolidations of existing facilities could adversely affect our operations. 
 From time to time, we may decide to enter new markets, build or lease additional facilities, expand our existing facilities, relocate or consolidate one or more of our operations or exit a facility we may own or lease. Increased costs and production delays arising from the staffing, relocation, sublease, expansion or consolidation of our facilities could adversely affect our business and results of operations. 
 Quality problems with our products could harm our reputation and erode our competitive position. 
 The success of our business depends upon the quality of our products and our relationships with customers. In the event that one of our products fails to meet our customers' standards or safety requirements or fails to operate effectively, our reputation could be harmed, which would adversely affect our marketing and sales efforts. We provide warranties to our customers for our products and services, and the cost to satisfy customer warranty claims, which may include, among other things, costs for the repair or replacement of products could adversely impact our business and results of operations. 
 Many of our contracts contain performance obligations that may subject us to penalties or additional liabilities. 
 Many of our customer contracts have schedule and performance obligation clauses that, if we fail to meet, could subject us to penalty provisions, liquidated damages or claims against us, or our outstanding letters of credit or performance bonds. In addition, some customer contracts stipulate protection against our gross negligence or willful misconduct. Each individual contract seeks to define the conditions under which the customer may make a claim against us. Due to the growth in our backlog, our manufacturing and fabrication capacity as well as ability to recruit and retain qualified labor is challenged resulting in an increased risk of meeting delivery dates and other contract performance obligations. It is possible that adjustments arising from such claims, or our failure to manage our contract risk, may not be covered by insurance and could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. 
 10 

Growth and product diversification through strategic acquisitions involve a number of risks. 
 Our strategy includes the pursuit of growth and product diversification through the acquisition of companies or assets and entering into joint ventures that could enable us to expand our geographic coverage and product and service offerings. We periodically review potential acquisitions; however, we may be unable to successfully implement this strategy. Acquisitions involve certain risks, including distraction of management, difficulties in the integration of operations and systems; failure to realize cost savings; the termination of relationships by key personnel and customers of the acquired company and a failure to retain or add additional employees to handle the increased volume of business. Additionally, financial and accounting challenges and complexities in areas such as valuation, tax planning, treasury management, systems integration and financial reporting from our acquisitions may impact our operating results. Due diligence may not be adequate or reveal all risks and challenges associated with our acquisitions. Companies that we acquire may not achieve revenues, profitability or cash flows that we expect, or that ultimately justify the investment. It is possible that impairment charges resulting from the overpayment for an acquisition may negatively impact our results of operations. Financing for acquisitions may require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available on attractive terms, if at all, or which may be restricted under the terms of our credit facility or other financing arrangements. Any failure to successfully complete or successfully integrate acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 
 Misconduct by our employees or subcontractors, or a failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations, could harm our reputation, damage our relationships with customers and subject us to criminal and civil enforcement actions. 
 Misconduct, fraud, non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations or other improper activities by one or more of our employees or subcontractors could have a significant negative impact on our business and reputation. While we take precautions to prevent and detect these activities, such precautions may not be effective and are subject to inherent limitations, including human error and fraud. Acts of misconduct, or our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations, could subject us to fines and penalties, harm our reputation, or damage our relationships with customers and could adversely impact our business and results of operations. 
 Unsatisfactory safety performance may subject us to penalties, negatively impact customer relationships, result in higher operating costs, and negatively impact employee morale and turnover. 
 We have both indoor and outdoor manufacturing and fabrication facilities that are susceptible to numerous industrial safety risks that can lead to personal injury, loss of life, damage to property or equipment, and potential environmental damage. While we take precautions to avoid incidents, we have experienced accidents in the past and may again in the future, which can negatively affect our safety record. A poor safety record can harm our reputation with existing and potential customers, jeopardize our relationship with employees, increase our insurance and operating costs and could adversely impact our business and results of operations. 
 Risk Factors Related to our Financial Condition and Markets 
 Global economic uncertainty and financial market conditions may impact our customer base, suppliers and backlog. 
 Various factors drive demand for our products and services, including the price and demand for oil and gas, capital expenditures, economic forecasts, global political environments (including war and terrorism) and the cost of capital. Unanticipated increases in raw material and component requirements or prices, the imposition of tariffs, and changes in supplier availability or supplier consolidation could increase production costs and adversely affect profitability. Uncertainty regarding these factors could impact our customers and severely impact the demand for projects and orders for our products and services. Additionally, the loss of significant volume from one particular customer at one of our facilities could adversely impact the operating results of that facility. Our ability to maintain or expand our business would be limited in the future if we are unable to maintain or increase our bonding capacity or our bank credit facility on favorable terms or at all. Similarly, disruptions in the capital markets or increased interest rates may also adversely impact our customer's ability to finance projects, which could result in contract cancellations or delays. These disruptions could lead to reduced demand for our products and services and cancellation of existing projects, and could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 11 

Fluctuations in the price and supply of materials used to manufacture our products may reduce our profits and could adversely impact our ability to meet commitments to our customers. 
 Our material costs equaled approximately 47 of our consolidated revenues for Fiscal 2024. Unanticipated shortages in raw material and components, rising prices due to overall inflationary pressure, the imposition of tariffs, or delays in production or transportation could increase production costs or lead times and adversely affect profitability as fixed-price contracts may prohibit our ability to charge the customer for the increase in raw material prices. 
 While we typically mitigate our inventory risks by increasing the levels of inventory for certain key components and raw materials and entering into commodity hedges when appropriate, such increased inventory levels may not be adequate to meet future demand and may increase the potential for excess and obsolete inventories, which could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations. 
 Obtaining surety bonds, letters of credit, bank guarantees, or other financial assurances may be necessary for us to successfully bid on and obtain certain contracts. 
 We are often required to provide our customers security for the performance of their projects in the form of surety bonds, letters of credit or other financial assurances. Our continued ability to obtain surety bonds, letters of credit or other financial assurances will depend on our capitalization, working capital and financial performance. Our ability to issue letters of credit is dependent upon the availability of adequate credit issued by our banks and could be negatively impacted by our compliance with our financial covenants. Future compliance with such financial covenants may be affected by factors beyond our control, including general or industry-specific economic downturns. We are also dependent on the overall bonding capacity, pricing and terms available in the surety markets. As such, we cannot guarantee our ability to maintain a sufficient level of bonding capacity in the future. The restriction, reduction or termination of our surety bond agreements could limit our ability to bid on new opportunities and would require us to issue letters of credit under our bank facilities in lieu of surety bonds, thereby reducing availability under our credit facility, which could have an adverse impact on our liquidity, business and results of operations. 
 Failure to remain in compliance with covenants or obtain waivers or amendments under our credit agreement could adversely impact our business. 
 Our credit agreement contains various financial covenants and restrictions, which includes maintaining a consolidated net leverage ratio of less than 3.0 to 1.0 and a consolidated interest coverage ratio of greater than 3.0 to 1.0. For more information on our credit agreement and the restrictions thereunder, see Note G of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Our ability to remain in compliance with such financial covenants and restrictions may be affected by factors beyond our control, including general or industry-specific economic downturns. If we fail to remain in compliance with such covenants and restrictions, absent an amendment or waiver, this could result in an event of default under the credit agreement. Among other things, the occurrence of an event of default could limit our ability to pay dividends, issue letters of credit, or obtain additional financing or result in acceleration of outstanding amounts under the credit agreement or a termination of the agreement, any of which could have an adverse impact on our liquidity, business and results of operations. 
 We extend credit to customers in conjunction with our performance under fixed-price contracts which subjects us to potential credit risks. 
 We typically agree to allow our customers to defer payment on projects until certain performance milestones have been met or until the projects are substantially completed, and customers often withhold some portion of amounts due to us as retainage. Our payment arrangements subject us to potential credit risk related to changes in business, financial markets and economic factors affecting our customers, including material changes in our customers' revenues or cash flows. If we are unable to collect amounts owed to us, or retain amounts paid to us, our cash flows would be adversely impacted, and we could experience losses if those amounts exceed current allowances. Any of these factors could adversely impact our business and results of operations. 
 12 

A significant portion of our revenues may be concentrated among a small number of customers and may be subject to the risks of particular industries. 
 Due to the nature and timing of large projects, a significant percentage of our revenues in a given period may result from one specific contract, customer or industry. For instance, we have a significant concentration of customers in the oil and gas, petrochemical and electric utility industries. Additionally, from time to time, one of our manufacturing facilities may have significant volume from one particular customer or industry that would be material to that facility. If such customers were to experience financial distress or a decline in business, or if the industries our customers concentrated in were to experience a significant change in the demand for such industry s products or services, our revenue and results of operations could be adversely impacted. 
 Our international operations expose us to risks that are different from, or possibly greater than, the risks we are exposed to domestically and may adversely affect our operations. 
 Revenues associated with projects located outside of the United States, including revenues generated from our operations in the U.K. and Canada, accounted for approximately 16 of our consolidated revenues in Fiscal 2024. While our manufacturing facilities are located in developed countries with historically stable operating and fiscal environments, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected by a number of factors, including political and economic instability; social unrest, acts of terrorism, force majeure, war or other armed conflict; inflation; changes in tax laws; the application of foreign labor regulations; currency fluctuations, devaluations and conversion restrictions or governmental activities that limit or disrupt markets, restrict payments or limit the movement of funds and trade restrictions or economic embargoes imposed by the United States or other countries. Additionally, compliance with foreign and domestic import and export regulations, including laws and regulations of the U.S. Treasury Department s Office of Foreign Assets Control, and anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, and similar laws of other jurisdictions outside the United States, could adversely impact our ability to compete for contracts in the applicable governing jurisdiction. Moreover, the violation of such laws or regulations, by us or our representatives, could result in severe penalties including monetary fines, criminal proceedings and suspension of export privileges. 
 Additionally, fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates may impact our financial results. The functional currency of our foreign operations is typically the currency of the country in which the foreign operation is located. Accordingly, our financial performance is subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar, and such fluctuations could adversely impact our financial position and results of operations. 
 Risk Factors Related to our Common Stock 
 Our stock price could decline or fluctuate significantly due to unforeseen circumstances that may be outside of our control. These fluctuations may cause our stockholders to incur losses. 
 Our stock price could fluctuate or decline due to a variety of factors including, but not limited to, the risk factors described herein, declines in the overall financial and economic outlook, timing and cancellation of projects, declines in new orders or backlog, changes in our estimated costs to complete projects, investors' opinions of the sectors and markets in which we operate or failure of our operating results to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, which could reduce investor confidence. These factors could adversely affect our business, and the trading price of our common stock could decline significantly. 
 There can be no assurance that we will declare or pay future dividends on our common stock. 
 Our Board of Directors has approved a regular quarterly dividend since our fiscal year ended September 30, 2014. The declaration, amount and timing of future dividends are subject to capital availability and determinations by our Board of Directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders and in compliance with all respective laws and applicable agreements. Our ability to declare, increase or pay dividends will depend upon, among other factors, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, current and anticipated expansion plans, requirements under Delaware law and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. A reduction in or elimination of our dividend payments could have a material negative effect on our stock price. 
 13 

We may issue preferred stock on terms that could adversely affect the voting power or value of our common stock. 
 Our certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our shareholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such preferences, powers and relative, participating, optional and other rights, including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our board of directors may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could adversely impact the voting power or value of our common stock. For example, we might grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we might assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock. 
 
 Risk Factors Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters 
 Our operations could be adversely impacted by the effects of government regulations. 
 We are subject to various government regulations in the United States as well as various international locations where we operate. These regulations cover several areas including Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) compliance, import and export controls, economic sanctions, data and privacy protection, transfer pricing rules, anti-bribery, anti-trafficking and anti-trust provisions. These laws and regulations are administered by various state, federal and international agencies. Changes in laws or regulations, or policy goals, including those affecting oil and gas exploration and development activities or climate change matters and the resulting decisions by customers of ours and other industry participants, could reduce demand for our products and services or for those of our customers, which would have a negative impact on our operations. For example, the Inflation Reduction Act contains tax inducements and other provisions that incentivize investment, development and deployment of alternative energy sources and technologies, and at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in the United Arab Emirates in 2023, more than 190 governments reached a non-binding agreement to transition away from fossil fuels and encourage the growth and expansion of renewable energy. In addition, regulations may limit or prohibit the use of a class of chemicals known as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), which are found in parts, components, and other materials used in products we manufacture or utilize. Such chemicals are critical to the manufacturing and functioning of many products, and there are limited technically and commercially feasible alternatives to them. These restrictions could adversely impact our business and results of operations by increasing our expenses or requiring us to alter manufacturing and assembly processes. Increased regulations and reporting requirements around the world may adversely affect the operators in the markets we serve. We cannot predict future changes in any country in which we operate or do business and how those changes may affect our ability to perform projects in those regions. 
 The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act requires disclosure of use of "conflict" minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries and our efforts to prevent the use of such minerals. In our industry, conflict minerals are most commonly found in metals. As there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering "conflict-free" metals, we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary metals in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Also, we may face challenges with our customers and suppliers if we are unable to sufficiently verify that the metals used in our products are "conflict-free." 

14 

Actual and potential claims, lawsuits and proceedings could ultimately reduce our profitability and liquidity and weaken our financial condition. 
 We are currently involved or may be involved in legal, regulatory and other proceedings. These proceedings may include, without limitation, product liability matters, intellectual property matters, contract disputes or claims, pending or threatened litigation, governmental investigations, as well as employment, tax, environmental, or other matters. We could be named as a defendant in legal proceedings that claim damages in connection with the operation of our business. Most of the actions against us arise out of the normal course of our performing services or manufacturing equipment. These proceedings could lead to law enforcement actions, adverse changes to our business practices, fines and penalties, business remedies, or the assertion of private litigation claims or damages that could be material, and which could adversely impact our business and results of operations. Even if the proceedings we face or may face in the future are decided in our favor, or are unfounded, we may incur material expenses and such matters may require significant management attention, and may harm our reputation with customers, employees or investors. 
 When appropriate, we establish estimated provisions against certain legal exposures, and we adjust such provisions from time to time according to ongoing developments related to each exposure, as well as any potential recovery from our insurance, if applicable. If, in the future, our assumptions and estimates related to such exposures prove to be inadequate or wrong, or our insurance coverage is insufficient, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, claims, lawsuits and proceedings may harm our reputation or divert management resources away from operating our business. Losses arising from such events may or may not be fully covered by our various insurance policies or may be subject to deductibles or exceed coverage limits. 
 Changes in tax laws and regulations may change our effective tax rate and could have a material effect on our financial results. 
 We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. A change in tax laws, deductions or credits, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation, in the countries in which we operate, could result in a higher tax rate on our pre-tax income, which could have a material impact on our net income. For example, several jurisdictions have implemented or are expected to implement in the future, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development Pillar 2, which is aimed at preventing base erosion and profit shifting, ensuring income is subject to a minimum level of taxation and preventing treaty misuse. The application of these provisions is not always certain, and jurisdictions are still developing their rules and interpretations with regard to the same. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities, and our tax estimates and tax positions could be materially affected by many factors including the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation, the introduction of new tax accounting standards, legislation, regulations and related interpretations, our global mix of earnings, the extent to which deferred tax assets are realized and changes in uncertain tax positions. A significant increase in our statutory tax rates or loss of our ability to claim Research and Development Tax Credits could have a material impact on our net income or loss and cash flow. 
 Failure to develop, obtain, enforce, and protect intellectual property rights or third-party claims that we are infringing on their intellectual property could harm our business. 
 We hold various patents, trademarks, servicemarks, copyrights and licenses. Our success depends in part on our ability to develop technologies and inventions and other intellectual property, and obtain intellectual property rights and enforce such intellectual property rights worldwide. We cannot be certain we will be able to obtain patents or other intellectual property rights in our new technologies and inventions, or if we do, the scope of such rights may not be sufficiently broad to afford us any significant commercial advantage over our competitors. The technologies and inventions developed by us in the future may not be considered valuable by customers or provide us with a competitive advantage, or competitors may develop similar or identical technologies and inventions independently of us and before we do. 
 Effective protection of intellectual property rights is expensive and difficult to maintain, both in terms of application and maintenance costs, as well as the costs of defending and enforcing those rights. Competitors and other third parties may also challenge the ownership, validity, or enforceability of our patents or other intellectual property rights. Moreover, the laws of certain foreign jurisdictions do not recognize intellectual property rights or protect them to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. To the extent we do assert our intellectual property rights against third parties, we may not be successful and adequate remedies may not be available in the event of infringement or unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights, or disclosure of our trade secrets. 
 15 

Third parties may in the future assert that we have infringed, misappropriated, or otherwise violated their intellectual property rights. We cannot assure that our current or future technologies are not infringing or violating intellectual property rights of third parties. In the event we face claims of infringement or misappropriation, we may face expensive litigation or indemnification obligations, be required to enter into licenses, and may be prevented from selling existing products and pursuing product development or commercialization. Even if such claims are without merit, we may be required to expend significant time and resources on the defense of such claims. If we are unable to sufficiently protect our patent and other proprietary rights or if we infringe on or misappropriate proprietary rights of others, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely impacted. 
 Provisions of our charter documents or Delaware law could delay or prevent a change in control of our company, even if that change would be beneficial to our shareholders. 
 The existence of some provisions in our corporate documents and certain aspects of Delaware law could delay or prevent a change of control of our company, even if that change would be beneficial to our shareholders. Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws include provisions related to the classification, nomination and removal of directors and the ability of our shareholders to bring matters for action at our annual meetings, among other provisions. Provisions of Delaware law include certain restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15 or more of our outstanding common stock. 
 Such provisions may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that shareholders might otherwise consider favorable, including transactions in which shareholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares, and may frustrate or prevent any attempt by our shareholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult to replace or remove our Board of Directors. 
 Significant developments arising from tariffs and other economic proposals could adversely impact our business. 
 Additional restrictions or economic disincentives on United States or international trade such as significant increases in tariffs on goods could adversely impact our business. Changes in United States or international social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, development and investment in the territories and countries where we currently develop and sell our products, and any negative sentiment towards the United States as a result of such changes, could adversely impact our business and results of operations. 
 Failures or weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting could adversely affect our ability to report on our financial condition and results of operations accurately or on a timely basis. 
 We are required to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which requires, among other things, an assessment by our management of our internal control over financial reporting. Preparing our financial statements involves a number of complex processes, many of which are performed manually and dependent upon individual data input or review. We seek to maintain and strengthen our internal controls over operational and financial reporting. However, any system of controls has limitations, including the possibility of human error, availability of qualified personnel, circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud. Our failure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting could adversely affect our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis, which could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports or a decline in our stock price, or have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations. 
 16 

General Risk Factors 
 We carry insurance against many potential liabilities, but our management of risk may leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risks. 
 Although we maintain insurance policies with respect to our estimated exposures, including certain casualty, property, professional, employee liability, business interruption, cybersecurity and self-insured medical programs, these policies contain deductibles, self-insured retentions and limits of coverage. In addition, we may not be able to continue to obtain insurance at commercially reasonable rates, or at the policy limits we may require or may be faced with liabilities not covered by insurance, such as, but not limited to, cybersecurity, environmental contamination, acts of war or terrorist attacks. We estimate our liabilities for known claims and unpaid claims and expenses based on information available as well as projections for claims incurred but not reported. However, insurance liabilities, some of which are self-insured, are difficult to estimate due to various factors. If any of our insurance policies, coverage limits or programs are not effective in mitigating our risks, we may incur losses that are not covered by our insurance policies, that are subject to deductibles or that exceed our estimated accruals or our insurance policy limits, which could adversely impact our business and results of operations. 
 Catastrophic events, including natural disasters, health epidemics, acts of war and terrorism, cl imate change, among others, could disrupt our business. 
 The occurrence of catastrophic events, ranging from natural d isasters and extreme weather conditions to health epidemics, to acts of war and terrorism, among others, could increase operating costs or disrupt or delay our ability to operate our business and complete projects for our customers and could potentially expose us to third-party liability claims or liquidated damages under our contracts. A significant portion of our operations are located near the Texas Gulf Coast; as a result, our operations have been and are subject to the potential impacts of weather-related events, including but not limited to hurricanes and flooding. Future weather events could cause significant damage to our property and equipment or customer projects and adversely impact our operations. In addition, global climate change may result in significant natural disasters occurring more frequently or with greater intensity, such as drought, wildfires, storms, sea-level rise, changing precipitation and flooding. Such events may adversely impact critical infrastructure, have the potential to disrupt our business, our third-party suppliers or the business of our customers, and may cause us to experience higher attrition, losses and additional costs to maintain or resume operations. We may declare the existence of a force majeure event under our contracts in certain situations; however, a customer may dispute our force majeure claim, which may result in additional liabilities. Losses or delays arising from such events may or may not be fully covered by our various insurance policies or may be subject to deductibles or exceed coverage limits. In addition, such events could result in temporary or long-term delays of existing projects as well as cancellations of orders for raw materials from our suppliers that could impact our project execution. These situations or other disruptions are outside of our control and may adversely impact our business and results of operations. 
 A failure in our business systems or cybersecurity attacks on any of our facilities, or those of third parties, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and reputation. 
 We rely on information technology systems, networks and infrastructure in managing our day-to-day operations. In the event of systems failure or interruption, including those related to force majeure, telecommunications failures, criminal acts, including hardware/software break-ins, extortion attempts, viruses, or other cybersecurity incidents, we may have limited ability to affect the timing and success of systems restoration, and any resulting interruption in our ability to manage or operate our business could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and reputation. 
 Increased global information technology cybersecurity threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks, and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data and communications. While we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures, including employee education, comprehensive monitoring of our networks and systems, and maintenance of backup and protective systems, our systems, networks and products remain potentially vulnerable to advanced persistent threats. Depending on their nature and scope, such threats could potentially lead to the compromise of confidential information and communications, improper use of our systems and networks, manipulation and destruction of data, defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions, which in turn could adversely affect our reputation, competitiveness and results of operations. 
 If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures and our products could be harmed. We could lose potential projects and existing customers, our ability to operate our business could be impaired, we may incur significant liabilities, we could suffer harm to our reputation and competitive position, and our operating results could be negatively impacted. 
 17 

Our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to compensate for all liability relating to any actual or potential disruption or other security breach or incident. We cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred, that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our financial condition, operating results, and reputation. 
 Any significant disruption or failure of our business systems or cybersecurity infrastructure could damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 
 Data privacy, data protection, and information security may require significant resources and present certain risks. 
 We collect, store, and otherwise process certain confidential or sensitive data, including personal data and other information that is subject to laws, regulations, customer-imposed controls, or other actual or asserted obligations. The laws, regulations, standards, and other actual and asserted obligations relating to privacy and information security to which we may be subject, in the United States and globally, are evolving. For example, in the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation imposes stringent requirements applicable to processing personal data and provides for substantial penalties for noncompliance, and in the United States, California and numerous other states have adopted comprehensive privacy laws, with other states considering such laws. Many jurisdictions around the world have passed or are considering laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity, including laws that impose cross-border data transfer restrictions and require certain personal data to be maintained on local servers. 
 Any actual or perceived failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations, or contractual or other actual or asserted obligations to which we are or are alleged to be subject relating to privacy, data protection, or cybersecurity could result in claims, litigation, and regulatory investigations and other proceedings, as well as damage to our reputation. These could result in substantial costs, diversion of resources, fines, penalties, and other damages and liabilities, and harm to our customer relationships, our market position, and our ability to attract new customer engagements. Any of these could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, potentially in a material manner. 
 Changes in and compliance with ESG initiatives could adversely impact our business. 
 There has been an increased focus on ESG matters by consumers, investors, as well as by governmental and non-governmental organizations. For example, organizations that provide ESG information to investors have developed ratings processes for evaluating a business entity s approach to ESG matters. Although currently no universal rating standards exist, certain investors use these scores to benchmark businesses against their peers and, if a business entity is perceived as lagging, these investors may engage with the entity to demand improved ESG disclosure or performance. Consequently, a low sustainability score could result in exclusion of our securities from consideration by certain investment funds, engagement by investors seeking to improve such scores and a negative perception of our operations by certain investors. To the extent that our ESG initiatives are deemed to be insufficient by stakeholders, this could adversely impact our business, results of operations, stock price or competitive position. 
 Private lawsuits or enforcement actions by federal, state, provincial or foreign regulatory agencies may materially increase our costs. Certain environmental laws may make us potentially liable for the remediation of contamination at or emanating from our properties or facilities. Although we seek to obtain indemnities against liabilities relating to historical contamination at the facilities we own or operate, we cannot provide any assurance that we will not incur liabilities relating to the remediation of potential contamination, including contamination we did not cause. These potential environmental liabilities may or may not be fully covered by our various insurance policies and may adversely affect our business and results of operations. 
 Climate change regulations could require us or our customers to incur additional expenditures to either purchase new, or modify existing equipment or processes. These laws and regulations may also increase the cost of raw materials from our suppliers. The potential for future ESG and climate risk reporting requirements may result in additional costs to monitor, track and report sustainability measures. Additionally, increased attention to climate change, conservation measures, energy transition, negative attitudes toward oil and natural gas production and consumer demand for alternatives to hydrocarbons could reduce the demand for oil and gas applications. This, in turn, could adversely impact the demand for the products produced by our customers and, therefore, reduce demand for our products, which could adversely impact our business and results of operations. 
 18 

The departure of key personnel could disrupt our business. 
 We depend on the continued efforts of our executive officers, senior management and other key personnel. We cannot be certain that any individual will continue in such capacity for any particular period of time. The loss of key personnel, or the inability to hire, train and retain qualified employees, could negatively impact our ability to perform and manage our business.

Item 1C. Cybersecurity 
 
 Cybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy 
 Cybersecurity represents an important component of our overall approach to enterprise risk management. Our cybersecurity policies and processes are fully integrated into our Enterprise Risk Management program and are based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity (NIST Cybersecurity Framework), a toolkit for organizations to manage cybersecurity risk in its assessment of cybersecurity capabilities and in developing cybersecurity priorities. In addition to internal assessments, our cybersecurity strategy and capabilities are evaluated and audited against the NIST Framework and industry best practices by independent, third-party, leading specialists in cybersecurity. We strive to create a culture of cybersecurity resilience and awareness. This tone is set from the top and continuously reinforced with our employees through education and regular testing. We continue to improve our programs and invest in the security of our systems, operations, people, infrastructure, and cloud environments. Our cybersecurity strategy seeks to follow industry best practices designed to ensure compliance with applicable global privacy and regulatory requirements. To protect our customers, we administer physical, technological and administrative controls on data privacy and security. We regularly validate our security controls by performing penetration testing, compliance audits, as well as proactive security testing to ensure our systems and controls are secure. The Board of Directors is briefed on our strategy and roadmap in alignment with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. The Board receives annual updates on program maturity, cybersecurity risks, threat landscape and overall program progress. 
 
 Our cybersecurity risk management program is focused on the following key areas: 
 Education and Awareness 
 We provide required security awareness education and training to our employees and contractors with system access that focuses on various aspects of the cybersecurity world. Users of Powell's internal systems are required to complete an annual cybersecurity awareness training and are tested for awareness on a regular basis. We also provide tailored training courses to functional technology employees and employees who process personal or sensitive information. 
 Threat Management, Incident Response, and Recovery Planning 
 We have established and maintain a comprehensive incident response and recovery plan designed to identify, contain and eradicate cybersecurity threats, with recovery from an incident as rapidly as possible. Our information security team utilizes threat technologies and vendors to monitor and respond to security threats via a 24/7/365 Security Operations Center. In the event of a security incident, a defined procedure outlines containment, response and immediate recovery actions. The incident response plan is tested, evaluated and updated no less than on an annual basis. 
 Data and Consumer Privacy 
 Our data and consumer privacy program monitors, adapts to and works diligently to comply with changes in global privacy legislation. We have implemented technical, procedural and organizational measures designed to comply with applicable data protection and consumer privacy laws. We conduct external benchmarking, as well as privacy compliance audits, to stay abreast of developing privacy laws and understand developing risks, best practices and industry trends. 
 Third-Party Risk Management 
 We recognize the risks associated with the use of vendors, service providers, and other third parties that provide information system services to us, process information on our behalf, or have access to our information systems. The Company has processes in place to oversee and manage these risks. We have an information risk management program that includes a vendor risk assessment process, whereby we systematically oversee and identify risks from cybersecurity threats related to our use of key third-party service providers. 
 20 

Cybersecurity Governance 
 Our executive management team and Board of Directors oversee our policies with respect to risk assessment and the management of those risks that may be material to us, including cybersecurity risks. Our Board of Directors has delegated responsibility to the Audit Committee for the oversight of cybersecurity risks. While cybersecurity resilience is the responsibility of every employee and contractor, the cybersecurity program is led by the Chief Information Security Officer who reports to the Chief Information Officer. Our Chief Information Security Officer has extensive experience in network engineering and cybersecurity operations from both a practical and management standpoint. He leads global teams in cybersecurity and infrastructure operations and regularly attends training in cybersecurity and risk mitigation. The Information Technology (IT) Cybersecurity Risk Management Committee, comprising senior IT leaders, meets quarterly and reviews trending risks and remediation efforts, and reports to the Audit Committee. When necessary, we assign resources to mitigate and evaluate risks to the enterprise level as part of our Enterprise Risk Management program. 
 The Audit Committee receives a comprehensive annual report of cybersecurity risks, threat landscape, and overall program status. On an annual basis, the Chief Information Security Officer reports to the Audit Committee on various metrics on threat management, incident response and recovery planning, along with industry benchmarks. The Audit Committee reports on these matters to our Board of Directors as needed. In addition, the Chief Information Security Officer periodically presents directly to our Board of Directors on our cybersecurity program. 
 We believe that the risks from cybersecurity threats thus far, including any previous cybersecurity incidents, have no material impact on our business including our business strategy, financial condition or results of operations. For additional information about the cybersecurity risks, see Item 1A. Risk Factors . 

Item 2. Properties 
 We own our principal manufacturing and fabrication facilities and periodically lease smaller facilities throughout the United States, Canada and the U.K. Our facilities are generally located in areas that are readily accessible to materials and labor pools and are maintained in good condition. These facilities are expected to meet our needs for the foreseeable future. 
 We own 100 of the offices and facilities in the following principal locations as of September 30, 2024: 
 Location Description Acres Approximate Square Footage Houston, TX Corporate office and manufacturing facility 21.4 428,515 Houston, TX Office and manufacturing facility 53.4 290,554 Houston, TX Office, fabrication facility, bulkhead and yard 62.4 82,320 Houston, TX Office and warehouse facility 9.3 37,200 North Canton, OH Office and manufacturing facility 8.0 115,200 Northlake, IL Office and manufacturing facility 10.0 103,500 Bradford, U.K. Office and manufacturing facility 7.9 129,200 Acheson, Alberta, Canada Office and manufacturing facility 20.1 330,168 

Item 3. Legal Proceedings 
 We are involved in various legal proceedings, claims and other disputes arising from our commercial operations, projects, employees and other matters which, in general, are subject to uncertainties and in which the outcomes are not predictable. Although we can give no assurances about the resolution of pending claims, litigation or other disputes and the effect such outcomes may have on us, management believes that any ultimate liability resulting from the outcome of such proceedings, to the extent not otherwise provided or covered by insurance, will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations or liquidity.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, filed with the SEC on December 6, 2023. Any forward-looking statements made by or on our behalf are made pursuant to the safe-harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Readers are cautioned that such forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, and the actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. For a description of the risks and uncertainties, please see Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors included elsewhere in this Annual Report. 

Executive Overview 
 We develop, design, manufacture and service custom-engineered equipment and systems that distribute, control and monitor the flow of electrical energy and provide protection to motors, transformers and other electrically powered equipment. We are headquartered in Houston, Texas and primarily serve the oil and gas and petrochemical markets, the electric utility market, and commercial and other industrial markets. Beyond these major markets, we also provide products and services to the light rail traction power market and other markets that include universities and government entities. We are continuously developing new channels to electrical markets through original equipment manufacturers and distribution market channels. For additional information on the markets we serve, see Markets in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report. 
 In Fiscal 2024, we reported revenues of 1.0 billion, net income of 149.8 million, and generated 108.7 million in cash from operating activities. As of September 30, 2024, we had total assets of 928.2 million. 
 
 Outlook 
 Our backlog was 1.3 billion as of September 30, 2024, of which approximately 849 million is expected to be recognized as revenue during our fiscal year ending September 30, 2025. Although current commercial activity remains active in most of the markets that we compete in, we remain attentive to the macro environment and geopolitical events that may have an impact on future market activity. 
 Oil and gas and petrochemical markets. Our order activity remains strong in these markets. The North American market is responding to increased international demand for LNG and gas-to-chemical processes utilizing low-cost gas feedstocks. We believe the fundamentals of the U.S. natural gas market, through abundant supply and low cost, will continue to support investments in LNG, related gas processing, and petrochemical processes, and as a result, will continue to sustain our order activity associated with such markets. In addition to the traditional crude oil refining and other oil and gas downstream processes, we have recently expanded our end markets into hydrogen production, carbon capture as well as alternative fuels, such as biofuels and sustainable aviation fuel, in response to the demand for clean energy. 
 Electric utility market. Aligned with our strategy of end-market diversification, we seek to continue our focus and growth in electrical distribution substations, while also addressing a resurgence of power generation investment in this market. 
 Commercial and other industrial markets. We have experienced strong growth in these end markets driven by a mix of factors including increased investment in commercial and light industrial facilities for the production of various goods, the expansion of data centers and cloud computing, as well as the growing demand in industrial applications to support new technologies driving the energy transition. We are cautiously optimistic regarding the anticipated investment across AI applications that may drive data center growth and subsequently power generation demand. 
 
 25 

Business Environment 
 The markets in which we participate are capital-intensive and cyclical in nature. Cyclicality is predominantly driven by customer demand, global economic and geopolitical conditions and anticipated environmental, safety or regulatory changes that affect the manner in which our customers proceed with capital investments. Our customers analyze various factors, including the demand and price for oil, gas and electrical energy, the overall economic and financial environment, governmental budgets, regulatory actions and environmental concerns. These factors influence the release of new capital projects by our customers, which are traditionally awarded in competitive bid situations. Scheduling of projects is matched to customer requirements, and projects typically take a number of months to produce. Schedules may change during the course of any particular project, and our operating results can, therefore, be impacted by factors outside of our control. 
 Our operating results are impacted by several factors such as the timing of new order awards, project backlog, changes in project cost estimates, customer approval of final engineering specifications and delays in customer construction schedules, all of which contribute to short-term earnings variability and the timing of project execution. Our operating results also have been, and may continue to be, impacted by the timing and resolution of change orders and the resolution of potential contract claims and liquidated damages, all of which could improve or deteriorate gross margins during the period in which these items are resolved with our customers. Disruptions in the global supply chain have negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact our business and operating results due to the limited supply of, delays for and uncertainty in the timing of the receipt of key component parts and commodities. We continue to remain focused on the variables that impact our markets as well as cost management, labor availability and supply chain challenges. 
 We are subject to inflation, which can cause increases in our costs of labor, indirect expenses and raw materials, primarily copper, aluminum and steel. Fixed-price contracts can limit our ability to pass these increases to our customers, thus negatively impacting our earnings and operations in future periods. 
 During Fiscal 2024, we experienced commodity price volatility, in addition to the ongoing supply chain delays for specific engineered components that have been persistent. We are working closely with our suppliers to meet our customer commitments. In response to the increased cost environment and supply chain challenges, we strive to effectively manage our product pricing, delivery schedules and bid validity dates with our customers, as well as improve factory efficiencies and project execution, and as a result our gross margins have been improved in Fiscal 2024. 

Results of Operations 
 Twelve Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Twelve Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Revenue and Gross Profit 
 Revenues and costs are primarily related to custom engineered-to-order equipment and systems and are accounted for under percentage-of-completion accounting, which precludes us from providing detailed price and volume information. 
 Revenues increased by 45 , or 313.0 million, to 1.0 billion in Fiscal 2024, primarily driven by the increase in project backlog resulting from large contracts awarded during Fiscal 2023 and strong bookings throughout Fiscal 2024. Domestic revenues increased by 52 , or 288.6 million, to 846.5 million in Fiscal 2024. International revenues increased by 17 , or 24.5 million, to 165.8 million in Fiscal 2024. Our international revenues include both revenues generated from our international facilities as well as revenues from export projects generated at our domestic facilities. 
 In Fiscal 2024, revenue from our core oil and gas market (excluding petrochemical) increased by 53 , or 144.1 million, to 417.2 million in Fiscal 2024; petrochemical market revenue increased by 97 , or 91.4 million, to 185.6 million; revenue from our electric utility market increased by 18 , or 28.1 million, to 186.5 million; commercial and other industrial market revenue increased by 44 , or 45.9 million, to 149.9 million; and revenue from all other markets combined increased by 23 , or 9.6 million to 51.1 million. These increases in revenue were driven by improved market conditions in most of our end markets, increased capital spending in our core oil, gas and petrochemical markets, as well as our strategic effort to expand our business into electric utility and commercial and other industrial markets. Revenue from our light rail traction power market decreased by 22 , or 6.1 million, to 22.0 million in Fiscal 2024 due to less project volume in this market. For additional information on the markets we serve, see Markets in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report. 
 26 

Gross profit increased by 85 , or 125.5 million, to 273.1 million in Fiscal 2024. Gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased to 27 in Fiscal 2024 as compared to 21 in Fiscal 2023. This increase in gross profit is attributable to the higher volume levels across all of Powell's manufacturing facilities generating favorable volume leverage, strong project execution, and continuing effort to improve factory efficiencies while also managing product pricing that corresponds to current cost levels. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 8 , or 6.1 million, to 84.9 million in Fiscal 2024, primarily due to increased compensation expense and higher spending on infrastructure improvements. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to 8 in Fiscal 2024, compared to 11 in Fiscal 2023, resulting from higher revenues on our existing cost structure. 
 Income Tax Provision 
 We recorded an income tax provision of 46.2 million in Fiscal 2024, resulting in an effective tax rate of 24 , compared to an income tax provision of 14.4 million in Fiscal 2023 at an effective tax rate of 21 . In Fiscal 2024, the effective tax rate was favorably impacted by the estimated Research and Development (R D) Tax Credit and tax benefits related to the vesting of restricted stock units. These items were offset by state income tax expense, certain non-deductible items, and the tax impact of U.S. global intangible income. 
 In Fiscal 2023, the effective tax rate approximated the U.S. federal statutory rate. The favorable impacts of the estimated R D Tax Credit and the release of the valuation allowance previously recorded against the U.K. net deferred tax assets in the amount of 1.9 million were offset by state income tax expense, certain non-deductible items and the tax impact of U.S. global intangible income. 
 Net Income 
 In Fiscal 2024, we recorded net income of 149.8 million, or 12.29 per diluted share, compared to net income of 54.5 million, or 4.50 per diluted share in Fiscal 2023. This increase in net income is primarily due to higher revenues coupled with improved gross profit margins, as well as our disciplined cost structure. 
 Backlog 
 The order backlog, which is our remaining unsatisfied performance obligations, represents the estimated transaction price for goods and services for which we have a material right, but work has not been performed. The order backlog at September 30, 2024 was 1.3 billion, consistent with our backlog at September 30, 2023. Bookings, net of cancellations and scope reductions, decreased by 24 in Fiscal 2024 to 1.1 billion, compared to 1.4 billion in Fiscal 2023. Despite strong bookings in Fiscal 2024, the decrease in bookings was due to a normalization of the oil and gas sector with fewer large orders awarded in this sector during Fiscal 2024. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As of September 30, 2024, current assets exceeded current liabilities by 1.8 times. 
 Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments increased to 358.4 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 279.0 million at September 30, 2023. This increase in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments was primarily driven by our improved earnings due to increased project margins and volumes, partially offset by working capital allocated to projects in our order book, capital spending, as well as dividend payments. We believe that our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, as well as available borrowings under our U.S. credit facility, will be sufficient to support our future operating activities, working capital requirements, payment of dividends and capital spending, as well as research and development initiatives for the next twelve months and beyond. 
 On October 4, 2023, we entered into a third amendment (the Third Amendment) to our credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A. (as amended, the U.S. Revolver). The Third Amendment which added Texas Capital Bank as Syndication Agent and a lender, increased the amount of the revolving line of credit from 125.0 million to 150.0 million, and extended the expiry date to October 4, 2028. The aggregate commitment of 150.0 million consists of 100.0 million committed by Bank of America and 50.0 million committed by Texas Capital Bank. As amended by the Third Amendment, the lesser of (a) 60 million, (b) 60 of available cash, and (c) the aggregate face amount of the issued but undrawn letters of credit that are not cash-secured shall be deducted from consolidated funded indebtedness, when calculating the consolidated net leverage ratio. We have the 
 27 

option to cash collateralize all or a portion of the letters of credit outstanding, which would favorably impact the consolidated funded indebtedness calculation and the consolidated net leverage ratio. On June 26, 2024, in connection with the expected discontinuation of the publication of the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate (CDOR), we further amended the U.S. Revolver by entering into a Canadian benchmark replacement conforming changes amendment with Bank of America, N.A. that added and amended certain terms related to the replacement of the CDOR as a benchmark rate with the forward-looking term rate based on the Canadian Overnight Repo Rate Average. On September 24, 2024, in connection with the expected discontinuation of the publication of the Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index Rate as administered by the Bloomberg Index Service Limited (BSBY), we further amended the U.S. Revolver by entering into a conforming changes amendment with Bank of America, N.A. that added and amended certain terms related to the replacement of the BSBY as a benchmark rate with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. 
 As of September 30, 2024, there were no amounts borrowed under the U.S. Revolver, and letters of credit outstanding were 63.8 million. There was 86.2 million available for the issuance of letters of credit and borrowings under the U.S. Revolver as of September 30, 2024. For further information regarding our debt, see Notes G and H of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Approximately 77.7 million of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at September 30, 2024 was held outside of the U.S. for our international operations. It is our intention to indefinitely reinvest all current and future foreign earnings internationally in order to ensure sufficient working capital to support our international operations. In the event that we elect to repatriate some or all of the foreign earnings that were previously deemed to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S., we may incur additional tax expense upon such repatriation under current tax laws. 
 Cash Flows 
 Operating Activities 
 Operating activities provided net cash of 108.7 million during Fiscal 2024 and provided net cash of 182.6 million during Fiscal 2023. Cash flow from operations is primarily influenced by project volume and margins, as well as working capital requirements, the timing of milestone payments from our customers, and payment terms with our suppliers. The decrease in operating cash flow was primarily due to working capital impact as we allocate capital to the projects in the order book, partially offset by higher net income resulting from increased project volume and improved project margins. 
 Investing Activities 
 Investing activities used 21.9 million of cash during Fiscal 2024 and used 26.6 million in Fiscal 2023. The decrease in cash used in investing activities during Fiscal 2024 was primarily due to lower net purchase of short-term investments, partially offset by higher capital spending on property, plant and equipment in Fiscal 2024. During Fiscal 2024, our purchase of short-term investments was 9.7 million compared with net purchase of short-term investments of 18.8 million in Fiscal 2023. In July 2024, we made a cash purchase of land and buildings in Houston, Texas for 5.6 million to help further facilitate executing the current backlog as well as planning for modest future volume growth. In addition, we acquired intellectual property in December 2023 for a total consideration of 0.5 million, of which 250 thousand was paid in cash. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 19.3 million during Fiscal 2024 compared to 13.1 million used during Fiscal 2023. The increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to cash payments related to shares withheld in lieu of employee tax withholding, largely driven by the significant increase in our share price during Fiscal 2024 compared to Fiscal 2023. 
 Planned Capital Spending 
 We have planned capital spending of approximately 11 million on a facility expansion project at our products factory in Houston. We expect to complete the expansion project by mid-Fiscal 2025. We have spent 1.5 million on the expansion project in Fiscal 2024. 
 28 

Other Commercial Commitments 
 We are contingently liable for letters of credit and bank guarantees totaling 71.0 million as of September 30, 2024, with the following potential cash outflows in the event that we are unable to perform under our contracts (in thousands): 
 Payments Due by Period: Letters of Credit/ Bank Guarantees Less than 1 year 27,587 1 to 3 years 42,336 More than 3 years 1,064 Total commercial commitments 70,987 
 We also had surety bonds totaling 426.8 million that were outstanding at September 30, 2024. Surety bonds are primarily used to guarantee our contract performance to our customers. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We had no significant off-balance sheet arrangements during the periods presented. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities known to exist at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis, based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. There can be no assurance that actual results will be consistent with those estimates. 
 We believe the following accounting estimates to be critical in the preparation and reporting of our consolidated financial statements. 
 Revenue Recognition 
 Our revenues are primarily generated from the manufacturing of custom-engineered products and systems under long-term fixed-price contracts under which we agree to manufacture various products such as traditional and arc-resistant distribution switchgear and control gear, medium-voltage circuit breakers, monitoring and control communications systems, motor control centers, switches and bus duct systems. These products may be sold separately as an engineered solution, but are typically integrated into custom-built enclosures which we also build. These enclosures are referred to as power control room substations (PCRs ), custom-engineered modules or electrical houses (E-Houses). Some contracts may also include the installation and commissioning of these enclosures. 
 Revenue from these contracts is generally recognized over time utilizing the cost-to-cost method. Under the cost-to-cost method, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation. We believe that this method is the most accurate representation of our performance because it directly measures the value of the services transferred to the customer over time as we incur costs on our contracts. Contract costs include all direct materials, labor and indirect costs related to contract performance, which may include indirect labor, supplies, tools, repairs and depreciation costs. 
 29 

Performance Obligations 
 A performance obligation is a promise in a contract or with a customer to transfer a distinct good or service. A contract s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue as the performance obligations are satisfied. To determine the proper revenue recognition for contracts, we evaluate whether a contract should be accounted for as more than one performance obligation or, less commonly, whether two or more contracts should be combined and accounted for as one performance obligation. This evaluation of performance obligations requires significant judgment. The majority of our contracts have a single performance obligation where multiple engineered products and services are combined into a single custom-engineered solution. Our contracts include a standard one-year assurance warranty. Occasionally, we provide service-type warranties that will extend the warranty period. These extended warranties qualify as separate performance obligations, and revenue is deferred and recognized over the warranty period. If we determine during the evaluation of the contract that there are multiple performance obligations, we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation using our best estimate of the standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract. 
 Contract Estimates 
 Actual revenues and project costs may vary from previous estimates due to changes in a variety of factors. The cost estimation process is based on the professional knowledge and experience of our engineers, project managers and financial professionals. Factors that are considered in estimating the work to be completed and ultimate contract recovery include the availability and productivity of labor, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed, the availability of materials, and the effect of any delays on our project performance. We periodically review our job performance, job conditions, estimated profitability and final contract settlements, including our estimate of total costs and make revisions to costs and income in the period in which the revisions are probable and reasonably estimable. We bear the risk of cost overruns in most of our contracts, which may result in reduced profits. Whenever revisions of estimated contract costs and contract values indicate that the contract costs will exceed estimated revenues, thus creating a loss, a provision for the total estimated loss is recorded in that period. See Note E of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosures related to changes in contract estimates. 
 Variable Consideration 
 It is common for our long-term contracts to contain variable consideration that can either increase or decrease the transaction price. Due to the nature of our contracts, estimating total cost and revenue can be complex and subject to variability due to change orders, back charges, spare parts, early completion bonuses, customer allowances and liquidated damages. We estimate the amount of variable consideration based on the expected value method, which is the sum of probability-weighted amounts, or the most likely amount method, which uses various factors including experience with similar transactions and assessment of our anticipated performance. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if legally enforceable and to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur once the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. 
 Contract Modifications 
 Contracts may be modified for changes in contract specifications and requirements. We consider contract modifications to exist when the modification either creates new or changes the enforceable rights and obligations under the contract. Most of our contract modifications are for goods and services that are not distinct from the existing performance obligation. Contract modifications result in a cumulative catch-up adjustment to revenue based on our measure of progress for the performance obligation. 
 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
 We review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be realizable. If an evaluation is required, the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset are compared to the asset s carrying amount to determine if recording an impairment of such asset is necessary. This requires us to make long-term forecasts of the future revenues and costs related to the assets subject to review. Forecasts require assumptions about demand for our products and future market conditions. Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment, and our projections may vary from cash flows eventually realized. Future events and unanticipated changes to assumptions could require a provision for impairment in a future period. The effect of any impairment would be reflected in operating income in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. In addition, we estimate the useful lives of our long-lived assets and other intangibles, and periodically review these estimates to determine whether these lives are appropriate. 
 30 

Accruals for Contingent Liabilities 
 From time to time, contingencies such as insurance-related claims, liquidated damages and legal claims arise in the normal course of business. Pursuant to applicable accounting standards, we must evaluate such contingencies to subjectively determine the likelihood that an asset has been impaired, or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements, as well as evaluate whether the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. If the likelihood is determined to be probable, and it can be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss is recorded. The amounts we record for contingent liabilities require judgments regarding the amount of expenses that will ultimately be incurred. We use past experience and history, as well as the specific circumstances surrounding each contingent liability, including estimated legal costs, in evaluating the amount of liability that should be recorded. Actual results could differ from our estimates. 
 Warranty Costs 
 Estimated costs of warranties are accrued based on historical warranty claim costs in relation to current revenues. In addition, specific provisions are made when product failures are projected outside historical experience. Our standard terms and conditions of sale include a warranty for parts and service for one year. Occasionally, we provide service-type warranties that will extend the warranty period. Actual results could differ from our estimate. 
 Projects may require, on occasion, warranty terms that are longer than our standard terms due to the nature of the project. Extended warranty terms may be negotiated and included in our contracts. The allocated revenue associated with the extended warranty is deferred and recorded as a contract liability and recognized as revenue over the extended warranty period. 
 Accounting for Income Taxes 
 We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, based on the income tax laws and rates in the countries in which operations are conducted, and income is earned. This approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Developing our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment and expertise in federal, international and state income tax laws, regulations and strategies, including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and, if necessary, any valuation allowances that may be required for deferred tax assets. In assessing the extent to which net deferred tax assets may be realized, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the net deferred tax assets may not be realized. The ultimate realization of net deferred tax assets is dependent on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Estimates may change as new events occur, estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced or increased, additional information becomes available, or operating environments change, which may result in a full or partial reversal of the valuation allowance. We will continue to assess the adequacy of the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. Our judgments and tax strategies are subject to audit by various taxing authorities. 
 The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position and results of operations. 
 See Note I of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosures related to the valuation allowance recorded in relation to deferred taxes.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions we have entered into in the normal course of business. These risks primarily relate to fluctuations in commodity prices, foreign currency transactions and interest rates. 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 We are subject to market risk from fluctuating market prices of certain raw materials used in our products. While such materials are typically available from numerous suppliers, commodity raw materials are subject to price fluctuations. We attempt to pass along such commodity price increases to our customers on a contract-by-contract basis to avoid a negative effect on our gross margin. We enter into derivative contracts to hedge a portion of our exposure to commodity price risk. These contracts were immaterial to our earnings and cash flows for Fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022. In the future, we may enter into additional derivative contracts to further hedge our exposure to commodity price risk. Even though we continue to experience price volatility with some of our key raw materials and components, with the consideration of our hedging strategy, we believe our exposure to commodity price risk is minimal. 
 Foreign Currency Transaction Risk 
 We have foreign operations that expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risk in the British Pound Sterling, the Canadian Dollar and to a lesser extent the Singapore Dollar and the Euro, among others. Amounts invested in our foreign operations are translated into U.S. Dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded as accumulated other comprehensive loss, a component of stockholders equity in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We believe the exposure to the effects that fluctuating foreign currencies have on our consolidated results of operations is limited because the foreign operations primarily invoice customers and collect payments in their respective local currencies or U.S. Dollars. Additionally, expenses associated with these transactions are generally contracted and paid for in the same local currencies. Our realized foreign exchange loss was 0.8 million and 0.4 million, respectively for Fiscal 2024 and Fiscal 2023. These losses were included in selling, general and administrative expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. From time to time, our foreign subsidiaries may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge their foreign currency exposures, if any. These contracts were insignificant to our earnings and cash flows for Fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022. We do not typically hedge our exposure to potential foreign currency translation adjustments. 
 
 Our accumulated other comprehensive loss, which is included as a component of stockholders equity, was 24.4 million as of September 30, 2024, a decrease of 2.5 million compared to September 30, 2023. This decrease in comprehensive loss was primarily a result of fluctuations in the currency exchange rates for the Canadian Dollar and British Pound Sterling as we re-measured the foreign operations of those divisions. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 If we borrow under our U.S. Revolver, we will be subject to market risk resulting from changes in interest rates related to our floating rate bank credit facility. Because we did not have any outstanding borrowings under our U.S. Revolver as of both September 30, 2024 and 2023, we have not experienced any significant interest rate risk for each of the periods presented in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Powell Industries, Inc. 
 
 Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Powell Industries, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company") as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income, of shareholders' equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2024, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 
 
 In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. 
 
 Basis for Opinions 
 
 The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 
 Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions 
 34 

and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 
 Revenue Recognition - Long-term fixed price contracts 
 
 As described in Notes B and E to the consolidated financial statements, approximately 95 of the Company s total revenue of 1,012 million for the year ended September 30, 2024 was generated from the manufacturing of custom-engineered products and systems under long-term fixed-price contracts. Revenue from these contracts is generally recognized over time utilizing the cost-to-cost method to measure the extent of progress toward the completion of the performance obligation and the recognition of revenue over time. Management believes that this method is the most accurate representation of performance, because it directly measures the value of the services transferred to the customer over time as costs are incurred on the contracts. Contract costs include all direct materials, labor, and indirect costs related to contract performance, which may include indirect labor, supplies, tools, repairs and depreciation costs. Under the cost-to-cost method, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation. Due to the nature of the contracts, estimating total cost and revenue can be complex and subject to variability due to change orders, back charges, spare parts, early completion bonuses, customer allowances and liquidated damages. Management estimates the amount of variable consideration based on the expected value method, which is the sum of the probability-weighted amount, or the most likely amount method which uses various factors including experience with similar transactions and assessment of anticipated performance. 
 
 The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognized over time utilizing the cost-to-cost method is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when determining the estimated total cost and revenue, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and in evaluating management s judgment about assumptions related to the estimates of costs to complete and liquidated damages. 
 
 Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the revenue recognition process, including controls over the determination of total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation and determination of total contract price. These procedures also included, among others, evaluating and testing management s process for determining the estimated total cost and revenue for a sample of contracts, which included (i) obtaining executed purchase orders and agreements, (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the method to measure estimated total cost and revenue, (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used by management, and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of significant assumptions related to the total estimated costs at completion and liquidated damages used by management and considering the factors that can affect 
 35 

the accuracy of those estimates. Evaluating the reasonableness of significant assumptions related to estimated total cost involved assessing management s ability to reasonably estimate total costs to complete and liquidated damages by testing management s process to evaluate the remaining costs related to the performance obligation and evaluating the timely identification of circumstances which may warrant a modification to the total estimated costs or liquidated damages.

These extended warranties qualify as a separate performance obligation, and revenue is deferred and recognized over the warranty period. If we determine during the evaluation of the contract that there are multiple performance obligations, we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation using our best estimate of the standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had backlog of billion, of which approximately million is expected to be recognized as revenue within the next . Backlog may not be indicative of future operating results as orders may be cancelled or modified by our customers. Our backlog does not include service and maintenance-type contracts for which we have the right to invoice as services are performed. 
 For the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our operating results were positively impacted by million and million, respectively, as a result of net changes in contract estimates related to projects in progress at the beginning of the respective period. These changes in estimates resulted primarily from favorable project execution, reduced cost estimates and negotiations of variable consideration, discussed below, as well as revenue recognized from project cancellations and other changes in facts and circumstances during these periods. Project cancellations increased gross profit by million and million, respectively, for the years ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. Gross unfavorable changes in contract estimates were immaterial for the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Contract liabilities ) ) Net contract liability ) ) 
 Our net contract billing position remained a net liability at both September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, primarily due to favorable contract billing milestones. We typically allocate a significant percentage of the progress billing to the early stages of the contract. To determine the amount of revenue recognized during the period from contract liabilities, we first allocate revenue to the individual contract liability balance outstanding at the beginning of the period until the revenue exceeds that balance. During the year ended September 30, 2024, we recognized revenue of million that was related to contract liabilities outstanding at September 30, 2023. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, we had retention amounts of million and million, respectively. Of the retained amount at September 30, 2024, million is expected to be collected in the next twelve months and is recorded in accounts receivable. The remaining million is recorded in other assets.

Our most restrictive covenant, the consolidated net leverage ratio, is the ratio of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation (EBITDAS) to funded indebtedness. An increase in indebtedness, which includes letters of credit, or a decrease in EBITDAS could restrict our ability to issue letters of credit or borrow under the U.S. Revolver. Additionally, we must maintain a consolidated cash balance of million at all times, which can be deducted from the letters of credit outstanding as noted above. The U.S. Revolver also contains a "material adverse effect" clause which is a material change in our operations, business, properties, liabilities or condition (financial or otherwise) or a material impairment of our ability to perform our obligations under the U.S. Revolver. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all of the financial covenants of the U.S. Revolver. 
 
 The U.S. Revolver allows the Company to elect that any borrowing under the facility bears an interest rate based on either the base rate or the eurocurrency rate, in each case, plus the applicable rate. The base rate is generally the highest of (a) the federal funds rate plus , (b) the Bank of America prime rate or (c) the BSBY rate plus . The BSBY rate will be replaced by the SOFR rate, effective November 20, 2024. The applicable rate is generally a range from to depending on the type of loan and the Company's consolidated net leverage ratio. 
 The U.S. Revolver is collateralized by a pledge of of the voting capital stock of each of our domestic subsidiaries and of the voting capital stock of each non-domestic subsidiary. The U.S. Revolver provides for customary events of default and carries cross-default provisions with other existing debt agreements. If an event of default (as defined in the U.S. Revolver) occurs and is continuing, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the U.S. Revolver, amounts and letters of credit outstanding under the U.S. Revolver may be accelerated and may become immediately due and payable.

 million as of September 30, 2024. We also had outstanding surety bonds totaling million, with additional bonding capacity of million available, at September 30, 2024. We have strong surety relationships; however, a change in market conditions or the sureties' assessment of our financial position could cause the sureties to require cash collateralization for undischarged liabilities under the bonds. 
 We have a million facility agreement (Facility Agreement) between Powell (UK) Limited and a large international bank that provides Powell (UK) Limited the ability to enter into bank guarantees as well as forward exchange contracts and currency options. At September 30, 2024, we had outstanding guarantees totaling million, with additional capacity of million available under this Facility Agreement. The Facility Agreement provides for customary events of default and carries cross-default provisions with the U.S. Revolver. If an event of default (as defined in the Facility Agreement) occurs and is continuing, per the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, obligations outstanding under the Facility Agreement may be accelerated and declared immediately due and payable. Additionally, we are required to maintain cash collateral for guarantees greater than . As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all of the financial covenants of the Facility Agreement.

million, which could possibly increase to million under certain circumstances. Based on our actual or projected failure to meet these various contractual commitments, million has been recorded as a reduction to revenue. We will attempt to obtain change orders, contract extensions or accelerate project completion, which may resolve the potential for any unrecorded liquidated damage claims. Should we fail to achieve relief on some or all of these contractual obligations, we could be required to pay additional liquidated damages, which could negatively impact our future operating results.

 Our income tax provision reflects an effective tax rate on pre-tax results of in Fiscal 2024 compared to and negative in Fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. The income tax provision for Fiscal 2024 was favorably impacted by the current year estimated Research and Development (R D) Tax Credit and benefits related to the vesting of restricted stock units. These items were offset by state income tax expense, the tax expense related to certain nondeductible expenses and an income inclusion related to U.S. global intangible income. 
 
 The income tax provision for Fiscal 2023 was favorably impacted by the reversal of a valuation allowance on the United Kingdom (U.K.) deferred tax assets that were previously fully reserved, in addition to the estimated R D Tax Credit. These items were offset by state tax expense, the tax expense related to certain nondeductible expenses and an income inclusion related to U.S. global intangible income. 
 
 The income tax benefit for Fiscal 2022 was largely a result of the reversal of a valuation allowance on the Canadian deferred tax assets that were previously fully reserved, in addition to the estimated R D Tax Credit. These items were partially offset by the tax expense related to certain nondeductible expenses, the gain on the disposition of a small, non-core division of our Canadian operations and an income inclusion related to U.S. global intangible income. 
 
 We record and maintain valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets of various foreign jurisdictions until sufficient evidence is available to demonstrate that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be recognized. As of each reporting date, management considers new evidence, both positive and negative, that could affect its view of the future realization of deferred tax assets. During Fiscal 2024, management determined that there was sufficient positive evidence to conclude that certain Canadian tax credits in the amount of million were realizable. The determination was based on the operating results of the past three years and the anticipated future taxable income from our Canadian operations. The release of the valuation allowance resulted in a million tax benefit and a corresponding increase in the deferred tax assets. 
 
 During the period ended September 30, 2023, management determined that there was sufficient positive evidence to conclude that the U.K. net deferred tax assets of million were realizable. This determination was based on operating results over the past three years and anticipated future taxable income from our U.K. operations. The valuation allowance was released accordingly, and a million tax benefit and corresponding increase in the deferred tax assets were recorded. Likewise, during the period ended June 30, 2022, management concluded that Canadian net deferred tax assets of million were realizable based on current and anticipated market conditions, continued market diversification, operating results over the past three years and anticipated future taxable income from our Canadian operations. The release of the Canadian valuation allowance resulted in a million tax benefit and a corresponding increase in the deferred tax assets. 
 We have not recorded deferred income taxes on million of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries because of management s intent to indefinitely reinvest such earnings. Upon distribution of these earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, we may be subject to U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes. It is not practical, however, to estimate the amount of taxes that may be payable on the eventual remittance of these earnings. 
 We are subject to income tax in the U.S., multiple state jurisdictions and certain international jurisdictions, primarily the U.K. and Canada. The significant jurisdictions that remain open to examination are as follows: Canada 2017 2023, U.K. 2023 and

 ) ) Retention and other ) ) Deferred tax liabilities ) ) Less: valuation allowance ) ) Net deferred tax asset (1) Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified for consistency with the current year presentation. 

We have deferred tax assets related to international net operating loss carryforwards of million that are not reserved with a valuation allowance available to offset future tax liabilities in the respective jurisdictions. The majority of these net operating loss carryforwards are related to our Canadian operations and expire beginning in 2035. The remaining unreserved net operating loss carryforwards related to other jurisdictions have an indefinite carryforward period. As of September 30, 2024, the majority of our tax credit carryforwards are fully reserved with a valuation allowance. 
 
 The net decrease in the total valuation allowance during the year was million, which was largely a result of the reversal of the Canadian valuation allowance on certain tax credits. In assessing the realizability of net deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the net deferred tax assets may not be realized. The ultimate realization of net deferred tax assets is dependent on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible.

 Included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits at the end of Fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022 are million, million, and million, respectively, of tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. Our policy is to recognize

million due to the expiration of certain federal statutes of limitations. We are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates regarding the timing of future cash outflows, if any, associated with the remaining unrecognized tax benefits for the open periods of fiscal years ended September 30, 2021 2024.

 Deferred Compensation 
 We offer a non-qualified deferred compensation plan to a select group of highly compensated individuals (as defined). The plan permits the deferral of up to of a participant s base salary and of a participant s annual incentive. The deferrals are held in a separate irrevocable rabbi trust (the Rabbi Trust), which has been established to administer the plan. The Rabbi Trust is intended to be used as a source of funds to match respective funding obligations to participants. The assets of the trust are subject to the claims of our creditors in the event that we become insolvent. Consequently, the Rabbi Trust qualifies as a grantor trust for income tax purposes. We make periodic payments into company-owned life insurance policies held in the Rabbi Trust to fund the expected obligations arising under this plan. Changes in the deferred compensation balance are recorded to compensation expense and reflected within the selling, general and administrative expenses line in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The plan is not qualified under Section 401 of the Internal Revenue code. We recorded net compensation expense adjustments of million related to this plan in Fiscal 2024 and million in Fiscal 2023. At September 30, 2024, total assets held in the Rabbi Trust were million and recorded in other assets and the liability was million and recorded in deferred compensation in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The million of assets held in the Rabbi Trust is invested in company-owned life insurance policies. 
 Retiree Medical Plan 
 We have an unfunded plan that extends health benefits to retirees that are also available to active employees under our existing health plans. The current plan provides coverage for employees with at least years of service who are age or older but less than . Effective January 1, 2023, eligibility for postretirement medical benefits changed to age with years of continuous service. Employees who are under age as of January 1, 2023 or who are hired after January 1, 2023 are no longer eligible for postretirement medical benefits. The retiree is required to pay the COBRA rate less a subsidy provided by us based on years of service at the time of retirement. The unfunded liability is recorded in other long-term liabilities and was million as of September 30, 2024 and million as of September 30, 2023. Our net periodic postretirement costs were immaterial for all periods presented in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Due to the immateriality of the costs and liabilities of this plan, no further disclosure is being presented.

 and increased the number of shares of common stock that may be issued under the plan by shares for a total of shares. 
 In accordance with the 2014 Plan, the Compensation and Human Capital Committee has authorized grants of RSUs to certain officers and key employees of the Company. The fair value of the RSUs is based on the price of our common stock as reported on the NASDAQ Global Market on the grant dates. Typically, these grants vest over a period from the date of issuance and are a blend of time-based and performance-based shares. percent of the grant is time-based and vests over a period on each anniversary of the grant date, based on continued employment. The remaining percent of the grant is earned based on the earnings and safety performance of the Company following the grant date. At September 30, 2024, there were RSUs outstanding. The RSUs do not have voting rights but do receive dividend equivalents upon vesting, which are accrued quarterly. Additionally, the shares of common stock underlying the RSUs are not considered issued and outstanding until vested and common stock is issued.

 Restricted Stock 
 In February 2022, our stockholders approved an amendment to the 2014 Non-Employee Director Equity Incentive Plan (the 2014 Director Plan) that extended the term of the 2014 Director Plan by and increased the number of shares of common stock that may be issued under the 2014 Director Plan by shares for a total of shares. The plan is administered by the Compensation and Human Capital Committee. Eligibility to participate in the plan is limited to those individuals who are members of the Board of Directors of the Company and who are not employees of the Company or any affiliate of the Company. 
 Under the terms of the 2014 Director Plan, the maximum number of shares that may be granted during any calendar year to any individual is shares. The total number of shares that may be issued for awards to any single participant during a calendar year for other stock-based awards (excluding stock options and stock appreciation rights) is shares. In December 2023, the Company's Compensation and Human Capital Committee revised the non-employee directors' annual restricted stock compensation from a fixed-shares arrangement to a fixed-value arrangement, retrospectively effective on October 1, 2023. Prior to October 1, 2023, each non-employee director received restricted shares of the Company s common stock annually. percent of the restricted stock granted to each of our non-employee directors was vested immediately, while the remaining percent vested on the anniversary of the grant date. Compensation expense was recognized immediately for the first percent of the restricted stock granted, while compensation expense for the remaining percent was recognized over the remaining vesting period. Subsequent to October 1, 2023, each non-employee director shall receive restricted shares of the Company's common stock valued at million annually. The number of granted shares is calculated by dividing the million by the average of high and low prices of our common stock on the grant date. The shares shall vest on the earlier of the grant anniversary date or the date of the next annual meeting of stockholders, whichever occurs first. 
 Under this 2014 Director Plan, in February 2024, shares of restricted stock were issued to our non-employee directors at a price of per share. In February 2023, we issued shares of restricted stock to our non-employee directors at a price of per share.

 Fair value guidance requires certain fair value disclosures to be presented in both interim and annual reports. The estimated fair value amounts of financial instruments have been determined using available market information and valuation methodologies described below. 
 
 Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents, primarily funds held in money market savings instruments, are reported at their current carrying value, which approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments and are included in cash and cash equivalents in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 Short-term investments Short-term investments include time deposits with original maturities of three months or more. 
 Rabbi trust assets and deferred compensation We hold investments in an irrevocable rabbi trust for our deferred compensation plan. The assets are primarily related to company-owned life insurance policies and are included in other assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Because the mutual funds and company-owned life insurance policies are combined in the plan, they are categorized as Level 2 in the fair value measurement hierarchy. The deferred compensation liability represents the investment options that the plan participants have designated to serve as the basis for measurement of the notional value of their accounts. Because the deferred compensation liability is intended to offset the plan assets, it is also categorized as Level 2 in the fair value measurement hierarchy. 
 There were no transfers between levels within the fair value measurement hierarchy during the year ended September 30, 2024.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We have established and maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed with the SEC pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 Management, with the participation of our CEO and CFO, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a 15(e) and 15d 15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, our CEO and CFO have each concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a 15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our system of internal control was designed using a top-down risk-based approach to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Due to its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become ineffective due to changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures. 
 Management of the Company has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024. Management evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on management s evaluation, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective at the reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024, based on criteria in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. 
 PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited and issued their attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, which appears in their report on the financial statements included herein. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 of the Exchange Act that occurred during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Description of Powell Industries, Inc. s Securities 
 Registered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
 We have one class of securities, our common stock, registered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Our common stock is listed for trading on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol POWL. Our authorized capital stock consists of 30,000,000 shares of common stock, par value 0.01 per share, and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value 0.01 per share. The following description of our capital stock is a summary and does not purport to be complete. It is subject to and qualified in its entirety by our certificate of incorporation (as may be amended or restated from time to time, Certificate of Incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as amended (as may be further amended or restated from time to time, Bylaws ), each of which is filed as an exhibit to our Annual Report on Form 10-K. We encourage you to read the complete text of our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. 
 Common Stock 
 Holders of our common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held of record on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders, may not cumulate votes in the election of directors and have no preemptive rights. Our Bylaws provide that in all matters other than the election of directors, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the subject matter at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the stockholders, unless the vote of a greater number is required by law and directors shall be elected by the holders of a plurality of the votes of the shares present or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors. 
 Our common stock is neither redeemable nor convertible into other securities and there are no sinking fund provisions or subscription rights in respect thereof. 
 Subject to all rights of the holders of our preferred stock or any series thereof, the holders of our common stock are entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by our board of directors (the Board ), out of funds legally available therefor, dividends payable in cash, stock or otherwise. 
 Upon any liquidation of Powell Industries, Inc. (the Company ), and after holders of our preferred stock of each series have been paid in full the amounts to which they respectively are entitled or a sum sufficient for such payment in full has been set aside, the remaining net assets of the Company shall be distributed pro rata to the holders of our common stock, to the exclusion of holders of our preferred stock. 
 Preferred Stock 
 The Board is authorized to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix by resolution or resolutions providing for the issuance of each such series the voting powers, designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights, and qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, of such series. No holders of any series of our preferred stock will be entitled to receive any dividends thereon other than those specifically provided for by our Certificate of Incorporation or the resolution or resolutions of the Board providing for the issuance of such series of our preferred stock. Upon any liquidation of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary, the holders of our preferred stock of each series will be entitled to receive only such amount or amounts as will have been fixed by or Certificate of Incorporation or by the resolution or resolutions of the Board providing for the issuance of such series. The issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of the Company without any vote or action by stockholders and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of the holders of shares of our common stock. 
 Limitation on Liability of Directors Indemnification of Officers and Directors 
 Our Certificate of Incorporation provides that no director of the Company shall be liable to the Company or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, which such limitation shall not eliminate or limit the liability of a director (a) for any breach of the director s duty of loyalty to the Company or its 
 1 

stockholders, (b) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (c) under Section 174 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the DGCL or (d) for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. This limitation may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors and may discourage or deter stockholders or management from bringing a lawsuit against directors for breach of their duty of care, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise have benefited our stockholders. 
 Our Bylaws provide for indemnification of our officers and directors to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL. In addition, we maintain directors and officers liability insurance. 
 Effects of Certain Provisions of Our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws and Delaware Law 
 General. Certain provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws and Delaware law could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control or the removal of existing management, of deterring potential acquirors from making an offer to stockholders and of limiting any opportunity to realize premiums over prevailing market prices for our common stock in connection therewith. This could be the case notwithstanding that a majority of stockholders might benefit from such a change in control or offer. 
 Board of Directors. Our Bylaws divide the members of the Board into three classes, each class to be as nearly equal in number as possible, serving three-year staggered terms. No decrease in number of directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent director. The classification of directors makes it more difficult for stockholders to change the composition of the Board at least two annual meetings of stockholders may be required for stockholders to change a majority of the directors, whether or not a plurality of stockholders favors such a change. 
 Stockholders may remove directors from office only for cause by the affirmative vote of stockholders holding a majority of the shares entitled to vote at an election of directors. Vacancies on the Board or newly created directorships resulting from an increase in the number of directors on the Board may be filled only by the vote of a majority of the remaining directors, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director. The number of directors may be fixed by resolution of the Board but must be no less than three nor more than fifteen. 
 Advance Notice of Stockholder Proposals and Director Nominations. Our Bylaws contain provisions requiring that advance notice be delivered to us of any business to be brought by a stockholder before an annual meeting of stockholders and providing for certain procedures to be followed by stockholders in nominating persons for election to the Board. Generally, the advance notice provisions provide that the stockholder must give written notice to our Secretary not less than 90 days nor more than 150 days prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of stockholders. The notice must set forth specific information regarding that stockholder and that business or director nominee, as described in our Bylaws. 
 Special Meetings of Stockholders. Our Bylaws allow the chairman of the Board, the chief executive officer, the president, a majority of the directors or one or more stockholders holding in the aggregate not less than fifty percent (50 of all the shares entitled to vote at the proposed special meeting to call a special meeting of the stockholders. Only business within the purpose or purposes described in the notice of the special meeting of the stockholders may be conducted at the meeting. 
 Amendment of Bylaws. Our Bylaws may be altered, amended or repealed or new bylaws adopted if approved by at least seventy-five percent (75 of the Board. 
 Delaware Anti-Takeover Statute. As a Delaware corporation, we are subject to Section 203 of the DGCL. In general, Section 203 prevents us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder (generally, a person owning 15 or more of our outstanding voting stock) for three years following the time that person becomes a 15 stockholder unless either 
 before that person became a 15 stockholder, the Board approved the transaction in which the stockholder became a 15 stockholder or approved the business combination 
 2 

upon completion of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder s becoming a 15 stockholder, the stockholder owns at least 85 of our voting stock outstanding at the time the transaction began (excluding stock held by directors who are also officers and by employee stock plans that do not provide employees with the right to determine confidentially whether shares held subject to the plan will be tendered in a tender or exchange offer) or 
 
 after the transaction in which that person became a 15 stockholder, the business combination is approved by the Board and authorized at a stockholder meeting by at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting stock not owned by the 15 stockholder. 
 Under Section 203, these restrictions also do not apply to certain business combinations proposed by a 15 stockholder following the disclosure of an extraordinary transaction with a person who was not a 15 stockholder during the previous three years or who became a 15 stockholder with the approval of a majority of our directors. This exception applies only if the extraordinary transaction is approved or not opposed by a majority of our directors who were directors before any person became a 15 stockholder in the previous three years, or the successors of these directors. 
 Transfer Agent and Registrar 
 The transfer agent and registrar for our common stock is Equiniti Trust Company, LLC.

Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

 Purpose The purpose of this Insider Trading Policy (the Policy is to promote compliance with applicable securities laws by Powell Industries, Inc. and its subsidiaries Powell or the Company and all directors, officers and employees. 
 Scope The Policy is applicable to all directors, officers and employees of Powell. 
 Policy If a director, officer, employee or consultant of the Company or its subsidiaries, family members both residing with and not residing with any of the aforementioned persons or any agent or advisor of the Company has material, non-public information relating to the Company, it is the Company s policy that such person may not buy or sell securities of the Company (the Company Securities or engage in any other action to take advantage of, or pass on to others, that information. 

I. INTRODUCTION 
 
 This Policy has been designed to prevent insider trading or allegations of insider trading. Your strict adherence to this Policy will help safeguard Powell s reputation and will further ensure that Powell conducts its business with the highest level of integrity and in accordance with the highest ethical standards. Each person subject to this Policy is responsible for the consequences of his or her actions. 
 
 Several provisions in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules thereunder, restrict transactions in publicly-traded securities by persons possessing inside information material, non-public information relevant to the value of such securities. In light of these provisions, it is imperative that all persons who possess material non-public information about publicly-traded securities 1) refrain from purchasing or selling such securities and 2) refrain from tipping (i.e. passing along) such information to others who may purchase or sell such securities. 
 
 Companies and their controlling persons may be subject to liability if they fail to take reasonable steps to prevent insider trading by company personnel.

 Governance Policies 

It is important that you understand the breadth of activities that constitute illegal insider trading and the consequences, which can be severe. Cases have been successfully prosecuted against trading through foreign accounts, trading by family members and friends, and trading involving only a small number of shares. 
 
 II. SANCTIONS AND PENALTIES 
 
 Violations of the insider trading laws can result in severe civil and criminal sanctions. For example, under 
 U.S. securities laws, individuals may be subject to imprisonment for up to 20 years, criminal fines of up to 
 5 million and civil fines of up to three times the profit gained or loss avoided. Failure to comply with this Policy may also result in disciplinary action by Powell, up to and including immediate dismissal for cause, whether or not any civil or criminal penalties arise from the inside securities trading. 
 
 III. PERSONS COVERED 
 
 This Policy applies to all directors, officers, employees and consultants of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Policy also applies to certain family members who reside with you, anyone else who lives in your household, and any family members who do not live in your household but whose transactions in Company Securities are directed by you or are subject to your influence or control (such as parents or children who consult with you before they trade in Company Securities). Any person subject to this Policy who is aware of material non-public information about the Company is prohibited from trading in Company Securities or engaging in any other action to take advantage of, or pass on to others, that information. You are responsible for making sure that any transaction in Company Securities covered by this Policy by any of these people complies with this Policy. 
 
 IV. DEFINITION OF MATERIAL NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION 
 
 Material non-public information is any material information about Powell that has not yet become publicly available. 
 
 Information is material if a reasonable investor would likely consider it important in making a decision to buy, hold or sell securities. Any information that could reasonably be expected to affect the price of the security is material. The information may be positive or negative. Financial information is frequently material, even if it covers only part of a fiscal period or a portion of Powell s operations, since either of these might convey enough information about Powell s consolidated results to be considered material information. Other common examples of information that may be material include 
 
 Information regarding sales, revenues or earnings (including projections) 
 Financial forecasts of any kind, including earnings estimates or changes in previously announced earnings estimates 
 Significant business trends and metrics

Significant proposed mergers, acquisitions, investments or divestitures 
 Significant developments in products or services 
 Gain or loss of substantial customers 
 Execution or termination of significant contracts 
 Financings or restructurings 
 Significant unusual gains or losses 
 Changes in business strategies 
 Developments in significant litigation or government investigations

 Significant changes in senior management 
 Powell share repurchases or 
 Stock splits or dividend information. 
 
 It is not possible to define all categories of material information, and you should recognize that the public, the media and the courts may use hindsight in judging materiality. Therefore, it is important to err on the side of caution and assume information is material if there is any doubt. 
 
 Information is non-public if it is not generally known or available to the public. Information may still be non- public even though it is widely known within Powell. Information is considered to be available to the public only when it has been released broadly to the marketplace (such as by a press release or an SEC filing) and the investing public has had time to absorb and evaluate it. Information about Powell should not be considered public until at least one full trading day has passed following its formal release to the market. 
 
 V. BLACKOUT PERIODS 
 
 Trading in Company Securities is prohibited during the Company s blackout periods. The Company has established four routine fiscal quarterly blackout periods throughout the year Quarterly Blackout Periods. Each Quarterly Blackout Period will begin as follows January 1st, March 1st, June 1st, and September 1st and will end 48 hours after the Company s fiscal quarterly or annual earnings are released. 
 
 Who is subject to the Quarterly Blackout Periods 
 
 Directors, officers and assistant officers of Powell 
 Employees with knowledge of financial performance forecasts 
 Investor Relations professionals 
 Attendees of the Company s fiscal quarterly business review meetings and

Family members or others living in the same household, family members whose transactions in Company Securities are directed by, or are subject to the influence or control of, the individuals listed above, and any entities that the individuals listed above influence or control. 
 
 From time to time, Powell may decide to impose a special trading blackout on those who are aware of particular information that Powell determines may be considered material non-public information. The Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer will determine whether an event-specific blackout should be imposed. The existence of an event-specific blackout will not be generally announced. If you are covered by the event-specific blackout, you will be notified by the Chief Financial Officer. Any person made aware of an event-specific blackout should not disclose the existence of the blackout to anyone else. 
 
 Employees not otherwise subject to the Quarterly Blackout Periods are encouraged to refrain from trading Company Securities during the Quarterly Blackout Periods to avoid the appearance of improper trading. 
 
 Pre-Clearance of Powell Securities Transactions 
 
 In addition to complying with the prohibition on trading during Quarterly Blackout Periods, all Insiders must first obtain pre-clearance from the Chief Financial Officer or his her designee using the attached Addendum before engaging in any transaction of Company Securities. 
 
 Public Disclosures Should Be Made Only By Designated Persons 
 
 No individuals other than specifically authorized personnel should release material information to the public or respond to inquiries from the media, analysts, investors or others outside of Powell. You should not respond to these inquiries unless expressly authorized to do so and should refer any inquiries to the Chief Financial Officer. 
 
 Post-employment Transactions May be Prohibited 
 
 The portions of this Policy relating to trading while in possession of material non-public information and the use or disclosure of that information continue to apply to transactions in Company Securities even after termination of employment or association with Powell. If you are aware of material non-public information about Powell when your employment or other business relationship with Powell ends, you may not trade in Company Securities or disclose the material non-public information to anyone else until that information is made public or becomes no longer material. 

VI. 10b5-1 PLANS 
 SEC Rule 10b5-1(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 permits corporate insiders to establish written trading plans (commonly referred to as 10b5-1 plans that can be useful in enabling insiders to plan ahead

without fear that they might become exposed to material non-public information that will prevent them from trading. Where a valid 10b5-1 plan has been established at a time when the insider was not in possession of material non-public information, trades executed as specified by the plan do not violate the securities laws or this Policy even if the insider is in possession of material non-public information at the time the trade is executed. Trades executed as specified by the plan are not subject to the pre-clearance requirement. 
 
 To qualify as a 10b5-1 plan for purposes of this Policy, the plan must be approved in advance by the Chief Financial Officer, and you should allow at least five business days for approval. 
 
 One of the factors that the Chief Financial Officer may consider in whether to approve a 10b5-1 plan is compliance with Powell s applicable minimum stock ownership guidelines. These pre-planned trading programs are available only to corporate officers and such other Powell employees as may be designated from time to time by the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer. For more information about how to establish a 10b5-1 plan, please contact the Chief Financial Officer. Powell reserves the right to disapprove any submitted plan.
