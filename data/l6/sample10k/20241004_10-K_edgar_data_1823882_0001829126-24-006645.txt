a 3 Exit Premium (as defined in the DIP Credit Agreement), earned upon the repayment or maturity of all or a portion of the DIP Facility,
and payable on the repaid or maturing amounts. The Commitment Premium and the Exit Premium do not apply to the New DIP Loans. 

The DIP Credit Agreement includes milestones, representations and warranties, covenants applicable to the Debtors, and events of default. If an event of default under the DIP Credit Agreement occurs, the DIP Administrative Agent may, among other things, permanently reduce any remaining commitments and declare the outstanding obligations under the DIP Credit Agreement to be immediately due and payable. 

The DIP Credit Agreement has a stated maturity date of October 8, 2024 (the DIP Stated Maturity Date ). The DIP Credit Agreement will also terminate and all obligations thereunder will become due on the date that is the earliest of the following (i) the DIP Stated Maturity Date, (ii) the consummation of any plan of reorganization under the Chapter 11 Cases, (iii) the consummation of a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all assets of the Debtors, taken as a whole, under section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code and (iv) the date of acceleration following the occurrence of an Event of Default (as defined in the DIP Credit Agreement). 

On July 23, 2024, the Bankruptcy Court granted
the Company s motion to approve the DIP Facility Amendment No. 1 to provide up to 5.0 million in additional funding to facilitate
continued operations until the Company receives required regulatory approvals and is able to emerge from bankruptcy and close the Restructuring
Transactions. 

Delisting 

In connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, on April 1, 2024, the staff of NYSE Regulation announced its determination to commence proceedings to delist the Common Stock from NYSE American, and trading of the Common Stock was suspended immediately. On April 10, 2024, the staff of NYSE Regulation filed a Form 25-NSE with the SEC to report the delisting of the Common Stock from trading on the NYSE American. 

The Company intends to file a Form 15 with the SEC to suspend the Company s public reporting obligations with the SEC under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act. 

Confirmed Plan 

All creditors entitled to vote on the Prepackaged
Plan, and who did vote on the Prepackaged Plan, have voted to accept the Prepackaged Plan. The Debtors communicated with various interested parties and resolved all comments on
the proposed Prepackaged Plan without changing the key terms outlined above. As part of that process, the Debtors entered into a term
sheet with Gogo Inc. which outlines the principal terms and conditions for a new revolving line of credit in the aggregate principal
amount of 20.0 million (the New Revolving Line of Credit ), and the assumption of certain commercial contracts between
the Debtors and Gogo Inc. (and its affiliates). The New Revolving Line of Credit is expected to be undrawn as of the Plan Effective Date. 

A hearing on confirmation of the proposed Prepackaged Plan took place before the Bankruptcy Court on June 28, 2024, at which the Bankruptcy Court confirmed the Prepackaged Plan.

Overview 

We are a U.S. headquartered, award-winning technical leader, in the 4G and 5G Radio Access Network RAN and broadband access solutions market. We offer a broad range of software defined radios, broadband access products and network management software to enable cost-effective deployment and efficient management of mobile, fixed and hybrid wireless networks. Our customers include leading mobile communications service providers CSPs ), large enterprises, military communications integrators and internet service providers ISPs working to deliver high-capability broadband access to numerous markets. Our mission is to disrupt and modernize network total cost of ownership TCO models. We aim to lower costs for customers throughout the product lifecycle, from procurement through commissioning and ongoing operating costs. We have been pioneering wireless technology for over 20 years and are distinguished by our deep customer relationships, innovative product design capabilities and expertise in solving technical challenges at the network edge, where a device or local network interfaces with the Internet or other networks. 

In 4G mobile networks, we established ourselves as an expert in network densification by focusing on solving the problems associated with physically locating, installing and commissioning networks consisting of hundreds of thousands of small cells as an alternative and supplement to macro cell-based networks. Software-defined and cost-optimized radio platforms, self-organizing/optimization algorithms and minimum power consumption have been critical to our 4G business and are expected to be even more critical to the deployment and expansion of new 5G networks. As an early leader in 5G OPEN-RAN standards, we have worked to unbundle the monolithic network architectures previously dominated by large incumbent suppliers such as Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson Ericsson ), Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. Huawei ), and Nokia Corporation Nokia ). As a foundational member of the 5G ecosystem, we work closely with wireless operators, chipset suppliers and infrastructure vendors around the world on 5G developments, trials, pilots and initial 5G deployments. 

The Wireless Communications Industry 

The wireless industry has evolved from Marconi s 1897 18-mile communication to a tugboat to high-speed mobile broadband. Launched in 2002, 3G cellular technology networks provided connectivity to access the World Wide Web from mobile devices and high-powered smart phones and apps began to change the way we live. Launched in 2010, higher speed 4G networks introduced the concept of mobile broadband, connected enterprise applications to cloud computing and began to modernize the way people communicate, interact and work. Presently, 5G networks, with up to 100 times the speed and as little as 10 of the latency (network edge turnaround time) of 4G networks, are expected to be foundational to the development and expansion of autonomous vehicles, telemedicine, live ultra-high definition video streaming, cloud gaming, edge computing and numerous industrial applications, such as augmented reality and robotics for smart manufacturing, supply chain automation and military and defense applications. 

Over the next ten years, we believe that 5G networks will become increasingly common across much of the globe, an expansion that will require substantial investment from stakeholders. Operators will need to invest in spectrum rights, network equipment and deployment well in advance of realization of any increase in revenues from the new capabilities that 5G networks offer. Airspan is working with leading global service providers and enterprises in the mobile and fixed wireless access FWA ecosystems to develop, commercialize and accelerate the availability of Open Standard 5G solutions that enable cost-efficient initial deployment and then, based on such open standards, allow those networks to efficiently adapt and grow in response to the emerging applications that are expected to generate increased revenue streams to recoup such network investments. 

Products 

We offer a complete range of 4G and 5G network build and network densification products with an expansive portfolio of software and hardware tools for indoor and outdoor, compact femto, pico, micro and macro base stations. Our solutions help network operators monetize the potential of 4G and 5G technologies and use cases and, in addition, allow enterprises to establish their own private networks especially in 5G, where dedicated spectrum has been allocated. The table below summarizes our product categories:

Regulation 

In addition to regulations of general application to global business, we are subject to a number of regulatory requirements specific to the wireless communications industry. Our products are subject to rules relating to radio frequency spectrum allocation and authorization of certain radio equipment promulgated by the Federal Communications Commission or the National Telecommunications and Information Administration. 

The applicable regulatory agency in each jurisdiction adopts regulations to manage spectrum use, establishes and enforces priorities among competing uses, limits harmful radio frequency interference and promotes policy goals such as broadband deployment. These spectrum regulations regulate allocation, licensing and equipment authorizations. Since our customers purchase devices to operate in specific spectrum bands allocated by the regulatory authorities, our products must meet the technical requirements set forth for such spectrum allocation(s). 

In some bands, the operator must seek prior regulatory authority to operate using specified frequencies, and the resulting spectrum license authorizes the licensee, for a limited term, to operate in a spectrum consistent with licensed technical parameters within a specified geographic area. We design and manufacture our products to comply with these technical parameters. 

Our products generally are subject to compliance testing prior to approval, and, as a condition of authority in each jurisdiction, we must ensure that our products have the proper labels and documentation specifying such authority. We generally use telecommunications certification bodies to obtain certification for our devices in each jurisdiction in which we intend to market and sell our products.

Competition 

We compete in two broad markets: mobile RAN equipment and services and wireless broadband access. We compete with large direct competitors in the RAN market such as Ericsson, Huawei, Nokia, Samsung Group and ZTE Corporation as well as smaller players such as Inseego Corp, JMA Wireless, KMW Co Ltd, and Mavenir. In the broadband market, we have direct competitors as well as competing access technologies. The competing technologies include wireline Digital Subscriber Line DSL ), fiber, cable and satellite. Direct wireless broadband competition includes Cambium Networks, Proxim Wireless Corporation, Ruckus Networks, a division of CommScope Inc. and Ubiquiti Inc., and many other smaller companies. In addition, some of the entities to which we currently sell our products may develop the capacity to manufacture their own products. 

When competing with the large incumbents for business in 4G networks, we rely on software centric small cell experience to provide densification solutions that fit under our larger end-to-end competitors macro cell architectures. Our 4G market has been limited to customers with severe capacity restrictions such as Sprint and Reliance that are difficult to address without massive densification. As 5G technology becomes more prevalent across the markets in which we operate, software and small cell-centric disaggregation of networks via O-RAN standards, instead of large macro-centric networks, allows us to take advantage of our competitive strengths, with increased access to CSPs utilizing 5G disaggregation to drive network buildout and to lower their overall operating costs. While we have an advantage within the O-RAN disaggregation market with both software modules and radio equipment based on our years of end-to-end RAN experience, we will have to continue innovation in access edge solutions, as software-only competitors such as Mavenir begin integration with commercial off-the-shelf radios and the larger incumbents such as Ericsson and Nokia invest time and resources into network disaggregation solutions. 

Competing Technologies 

Today, broadband connections can be provided with or without voice services by a number of competing access technologies. While the communications transport network and Internet backbone are capable of transporting data at extremely high speeds, data can only be delivered from those parts of the network through the access portion to the end-user as fast as the end-user s connection to the network will permit. Many traditional access connections that use copper wires are inadequate to address the rapidly expanding bandwidth requirements. To address these requirements, a number of alternative solutions have emerged. Below we have identified those solutions that we believe, for a variety of technological and economic reasons, compete most directly with the broadband wireless solutions we offer. Rural areas generally have fewer copper and wired infrastructures in existence. For this reason, we believe we have a particular competitive edge in rural and developing markets. 

The performance and coverage area of our wireless systems are dependent on some factors that are outside our control, including features of the environment such as the amount of clutter (natural terrain features and man-made obstructions) and the available radio frequencies. Any inability to overcome these obstacles may make our technology less competitive in comparison with other technologies and make other technologies less expensive or more suitable. Our business may also compete in the future with products and services based on other wireless technologies and other technologies that have yet to be developed. 

Wired Digital Subscriber Lines. Broadband access is provided today by wired technologies using both copper and fiber. Copper is used most often in residential broadband access systems. 

DSL technology improves the data transmission rate of existing copper networks. DSL transmission rates and service availability, however, are limited in all networks by both the quality of the available copper, which for many providers is a large percentage of their copper network, and by the maximum transmission distance (approximately five kilometers from the subscriber to the service provider s switching equipment in many instances) of wired DSL technology. In many instances, a substantial portion of an operator s copper network is unsuitable for DSL transmission. 

7 

Fiber technology allows an operator to deliver video, voice and data capabilities over an optical fiber medium that can deliver very high capacity to end-users. Because of the high costs associated with its deployment, fiber is used primarily for broadband access for businesses. It is most economically deployed in urban and suburban environments where business and residents create very high demand for services over broadband, and end-users can afford the relatively high tariffs charged by operators to provide fiber-based connectivity. 

Cable Networks. Two-way cable modems using coaxial cable enable data services to be delivered over a network originally designed to provide television service to residential subscribers. Coaxial cable has greater transmission capacity than copper wires but is often costly to upgrade for two-way data services. The data rate available to each subscriber on a cable link decreases as the number of subscribers using the link increases. Cable coverage, which is not available in many countries, may limit the growth of this segment as a broadband access medium. 

Satellite Networks. For a variety of technological and economic reasons, satellite technologies have not presented the most direct competitive challenge to the fixed wireless access systems we offer. We believe that newer Low Earth Orbit LEO systems will eventually find a role in remote access but will be vulnerable to the spread of terrestrial broadband facilities driven in part by the need for very low latency, high speed backhaul for ubiquitous 5G networks. 

Customers 

Our customers are principally network operators, who provide their customers with fixed, nomadic and portable broadband solutions, as well as backhaul and bridging solutions and mobile access solutions. Our customers today can generally be described as follows: 

Fixed and mobile carriers looking to provide high speed triple-play broadband services to a wide customer base; 

Energy, utility and enterprise and data centric carriers where high-speed connectivity is required between locations with a variety of private networking capabilities; 

Military, defense, air to ground and public safety network operators providing wireless connectivity across a broad range of applications; and 

Wireless ISPs that operate in areas where other carriers choose not to offer broadband access services. 

We began shipping our products in 1996. 

Our contracts with our customers typically provide for delivery of products and services, including training, radio planning and maintenance we provide. Our contracts sometimes include installation and commissioning, which are generally provided by subcontractors. In addition, we generally also agree to provide warranty for the equipment and software for a limited period of time. 

Our contracts are generally non-exclusive and may contain provisions allowing our customers to terminate the agreement without significant penalties. Our contracts also may specify the achievement of shipment, delivery and service commitments. We are generally able to meet these commitments or negotiate extensions with our customers. 

Our three largest customers have accounted for a substantial majority of our sales in the two years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. Our top three customers accounted for 68 and 61 of revenue in 2023 and 2022, respectively. See Note 2 of the notes to the audited financial statements included in this Annual Report.

Sales and Marketing 

We sell our systems and solutions through our direct sales force and through independent agents, resellers and original equipment manufacturer OEM partners. Our direct sales force targets network operators, ISPs and enterprises in both developed and developing markets. In certain markets, we also sell through independent agents, resellers, distributors and system integrators who target network operators and other customers. We also sell our products to OEMs who may sell our products under their names. 

Our marketing efforts are focused on network operators and ISPs that provide voice and data or data-only communications services to their customers. Through our marketing activities, we provide technical and strategic sales support including in-depth product presentations, network design and analysis, bid preparation, contract negotiation and support, technical manuals, sales tools, pricing, marketing communications, marketing research, trademark administration and other support functions. 

A high level of ongoing service and support is critical to our objective of developing long-term customer relationships. To facilitate the deployment of our systems, we offer our customers a wide range of implementation and support services, including spectrum planning and optimization, post-sales support, training, a helpline and a variety of other support services. 

Our subcontractors, who have the expertise and ability to professionally install our products, perform most major installations and commissioning. This enables us to efficiently manage fluctuations in the volume of installation work. 

As of December 31, 2023, we had 104 full-time employees and contractors worldwide dedicated to sales, marketing and customer service. 

Intellectual Property 

We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret law and confidentiality or license agreements to protect our proprietary rights in products, services, know-how and information. Intellectual property laws afford limited protection. Certain rights held by us and our subsidiaries may provide us with competitive advantages, even though not all of these rights are protected under intellectual property laws. It may be possible for a third party to copy our products and services or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary information without our permission. 

Through the development of our products, we have generated a significant patent portfolio. As of December 31, 2023, our development efforts have resulted in 210 separate patents granted (includes U.S. patents and various foreign counterparts), with a further 53 currently pending (includes U.S. patents and foreign counterparts) applications. To improve system performance and reduce costs, we have developed custom integrated circuits that incorporate much of our intellectual property as well as a large library of AI base software modules which are key elements of our wireless solutions. 

United States patents are currently granted for a term of 20 years from the date a patent application is filed. Our U.S. patents have in the past given us competitive advantages in the marketplace, including a number of patents for wireless transmission techniques and antenna technologies with a particular emphasis on high-speed mobility and power efficiency. 

United States trademark registrations are for a term of ten years and are renewable every ten years as long as the trademarks are used in the regular course of trade. We register our trademarks in a number of other countries where we do business. 

Manufacturing 

We subcontract our manufacturing to third party subcontract manufacturing service providers. These providers offer full service manufacturing solutions, including assembly, integration, test, prototyping and new product introduction. The following is an overview of where our products are manufactured. 

9 

Most of our 4G and 5G product families are all currently produced with Foxconn in their Vietnam facilities and some in Malaysia with a contract manufacturer. 

We also contract with smaller contract manufacturers for early life prototyping and engineering samples. 

Our agreements with our manufacturing subcontractors are non-exclusive and may be terminated by either party generally on six months notice without significant penalty. Other than component purchase liability as a consequence of authorized forecasts we provide, we do not have any agreements with our manufacturing subcontractors to purchase any minimum volumes. Our manufacturing support activities consist primarily of prototype development, new product introduction, materials planning and procurement, functional test support and quality control. All products are routed to customers via one of our third-party logistics partners. 

Some of the key components of our products are purchased from single vendors for which alternative sources are generally not readily available in the short to medium term. If these vendors fail to supply us with components because they do not have them in stock when we need them, if they reduce or eliminate their manufacturing capacity for these components or if they enter into exclusive relationships with other parties which prevents them from selling to us, we could experience and have experienced significant delays in shipping our products while we seek other sources. 

Human Capital Resources 

Employee Overview 

Our employees are instrumental in helping inspire us to achieve our goals. They bring a wide range of talents, experience and perspectives to drive our business. We are an equal opportunity employer, and it is our policy to make employment decisions and opportunities based on merit, qualifications, potential and competency. 

As of December 31, 2023, we had 428 full-time equivalent employees based primarily in the United Kingdom, India, Israel and the United States. We also engage numerous consultants and contractors to supplement our permanent workforce. We believe that we generally have good relationships with our employees. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement or represented by a labor union, nor have we experienced any work stoppages. 

Talent and Human Capital Management 

We believe that human capital management is an important component to our continued growth and success, and is critical to our ability to attract, retain and develop talented and skilled employees. 

Our human capital is governed by employment regulations in each country in which we operate. We monitor key employment activities, such as hiring, termination and pay practices to ensure compliance with established regulations across the world. Attracting, developing and retaining the best people globally is critical to our long-term success. 

Diversity and Inclusion 

We believe in attracting, developing and retaining diverse teams. We embrace diversity and inclusion and strive to provide an environment rich with diverse skills, backgrounds and perspectives. 

Incentive Plans 

The principal purpose of our incentive plans is to increase stockholder value by attracting, retaining and motivating high value personnel through the granting of equity and non-equity-based compensation awards. The incentive plans are designed to motivate individuals to perform to the best of their abilities to achieve our short and long-term objectives.

The information contained in, or that can be accessed through, our website is not part of, and is not incorporated into this document. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 

Our business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. The occurrence of one or more of the events or circumstances described in this section Risk Factors, alone or in combination with other events or circumstances, may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. In that event, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment in our securities. Such risks include, but are not limited to: 

Risks Related to the Chapter 11 Cases 

As a result of the Chapter 11 Cases, our financial results may be volatile and may not reflect historical trends. 

During the Chapter 11 Cases, we expect our financial results to continue to be volatile as restructuring activities and expenses, contract terminations and rejections, and claims assessments significantly impact our consolidated financial statements. As a result, our historical financial performance is likely not indicative of our financial performance after the date of the bankruptcy filing. In addition, when we emerge from the Chapter 11 Cases, the amounts reported in subsequent consolidated financial statements may materially change relative to historical consolidated financial statements, including as a result of revisions to our operating plans pursuant to a plan of reorganization. We also may be required to adopt fresh start accounting, in which case our assets and liabilities will be recorded at fair value as of the fresh start reporting date, which may differ materially from the recorded values of assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Our financial results after the application of fresh start accounting also may be different from historical trends. 

Emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases requires
government approval 

The Bankruptcy Court confirmed the Prepackaged Plan
on June 28, 2024. In order to emerge from bankruptcy, the transaction contemplated in the RSA and the Prepackaged Plan must be approved
by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States CFIUS and the Investment Security Unit (the ISU ),
the responsible regulator in the United Kingdom. On July 12, 2024, CFIUS approved the transaction contemplated in the RSA and the
Prepackaged Plan. On July 3, 2024, the ISU informed us that the transaction is subject to further review under the United Kingdom s
National Security Investment Act 2021 NSIA ). Due to the additional time required to address questions from the ISU under
the NSIA, on July 23, 2024, the Bankruptcy Court approved the Company s motion to enter into the DIP Facility Amendment No.
1 to provide up to 5.0 million in additional funds to cover operating costs during this process. On October 2, 2024, the ISU informed
the Company that no further action would be taken in relation to the call-in notice given under the NSIA. With this notice, the Company
has received all required governmental approvals necessary to emerge from bankruptcy and close the Restructuring Transactions. 

11 

Risks Related to Our Business and Industry 

We have incurred losses and may continue to incur substantial losses and negative operating cash flows and may not succeed in achieving or maintaining profitability in the future. 

We have incurred net losses and negative cash flows since incorporation, and as of December 31, 2023, we had an accumulated deficit of 930.1 million. We anticipate that we will continue to experience negative cash flows and net losses at least through the first quarter of 2025. Our operating losses have been due in part to the commitment of significant resources to our research and development and sales and marketing departments as well as competitive pressures. We expect to continue to devote resources to these areas and, as a result, we will need to increase our quarterly revenues or further decrease our operating expenses to achieve and maintain profitability. We cannot be certain that we will achieve profitability. If we do achieve profitability, we cannot be certain that we can sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future. Continuous cash outflows can lead to the need for new financing, which may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. 

Any reduction in expenditures by communications service providers could have a negative impact on our results of operations. 

Our products are sold to telecommunications carriers, service providers and telecommunications network operators. A decline in our customers capital spending may reduce our sales, increase the need for inventory write-offs and increase our losses and our requirements for additional working capital, which may not be readily available to us. This could result in downward pressure on the price of our products, all of which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and stock price. Further, the number of carriers and service providers that are our potential customers may not grow or may decline as a result of, among other things, the substantial capital requirements needed to establish networks and the limited number of licenses granted in each country. 

The introduction of new products and technology, and in particular 5G products, and managing the transition from legacy products, is key to our success, and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and network operators changing needs, we may be unable to remain competitive. 

The wireless broadband market is generally characterized by rapidly changing technology, changing needs of network operators, evolving regulations and industry standards and frequent introductions of new products and services. Currently, the race to introduce 5G products and technology is driving rapid changes in our industry. Historically, new product introductions have been a key driver of our revenue growth. To succeed, we must effectively anticipate and adapt in a timely manner to network operator requirements and continue to develop or acquire new products and features that meet market demands, technology trends and evolving regulatory requirements and industry standards. Our ability to keep pace with technological developments, such as 5G and LTE, satisfy increasing network operator requirements, and achieve product acceptance depends upon our ability to enhance our current products and develop and introduce or otherwise acquire the rights to new products on a timely basis and at competitive prices. The process of developing new technology is complex and uncertain, and the development of new products and enhancements typically requires significant upfront investment and commitment of resources, which may not result in material improvements to existing products or result in marketable new products or cost savings or revenues for an extended period of time, if at all. We are currently investing in the development of products and technology for the 5G standard once it is generally adopted in our target markets. There can be no assurance we will successfully address the new 5G standard in a timely manner or that our products will achieve market acceptance. Network operators have delayed, and may in the future delay, purchases of our products while awaiting release of new products or product enhancements. In addition, the introduction of new or enhanced products requires that we carefully manage the transition from older products to minimize disruption in customer ordering practices. If we fail to anticipate industry trends and evolving regulations by developing or acquiring rights to new products or product enhancements and timely and effectively introducing such new products and enhancements, or network operators do not perceive our products to have compelling technological advantages, our business would be materially adversely affected. 

12 

Competition from larger, better-capitalized or emerging competitors could result in price reductions, reduced gross margins and loss of or diminished growth of market share. 

We compete in a rapidly evolving, highly competitive and fragmented market. We now compete with companies that are producing both mobile and fixed wireless communications systems, wired DSL, cable networks, fiber optic cable, certain satellite technologies and other new entrants to this industry, as well as traditional communications companies. General anticipated increases in capital spending on 5G applications may result in new competitors entering the markets in which we sell our products. Competitors vary in size and resources and in products and services offered. With respect to the wireless solutions for 4G and 5G networks we offer today, we believe we compete directly with Altiostar, Cambium, Casa, Ciena, Ericsson, Huawei, KMW, Mavenir, Nokia, Samsung, Sercom and ZTE Corporation, and with a number of smaller privately-held companies. In addition, some of the entities to which we currently sell our products may develop the capacity to manufacture their own products. 

Many of our competitors are substantially larger than us and have significantly greater financial, sales and marketing, technical, manufacturing and other resources as well as more established distribution channels and greater name recognition. These competitors may be able to respond more rapidly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements than we can and can devote greater resources to attempting to influence the composition of future technological standards. They may also be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, sale and financing of their products than we can. Furthermore, some of our competitors have made or may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase their ability to gain customer market share rapidly. These competitors may enter our existing or future markets with systems that may be less expensive, provide higher performance or contain additional features. In addition, large customers are sometimes reluctant to base an important line of business on equipment purchased from a smaller vendor such as us. In addition, both larger and smaller communications service providers may also decide to wait to see how a new technology develops before committing any significant resources to deploying equipment from a particular supplier. We believe this tendency to wait and see with respect to new technology affects the consumer market, resulting in increased customer caution on purchases of new technology. 

We expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products or new technologies that may supplant or provide lower-cost alternatives to our systems. This and other factors could result in lower revenues or a loss of market share, which could cause our stock price to fall. 

We currently depend on a few key customers for a substantial percentage of our sales. A loss of one or more of those customers could cause a significant decrease in our net revenue. 

We currently derive, and expect to continue to derive, a majority of our revenues from fewer than five customers. 

In 2023 and 2022, approximately 68 and 61 , respectively, of our revenues were derived from our top three customers by revenue. We believe that there are certain economies of scale inherent in our business. Accordingly, if we lose one or more significant customers and are unable to replace the revenue previously generated by those customers, our gross profit margins, profitability and efforts to preserve cash resources could be materially negatively affected. 

The amount of revenue we derive from a specific customer is likely to vary from period to period, and a major customer in one period may not produce significant additional revenue in a subsequent period. We anticipate that our operating results will continue to depend on sales to a relatively small number of key customers in the foreseeable future. In general, our contracts with our larger customers often involve major deployments that require several months to fulfill, so our results may depend on the same major customers for consecutive quarters. We cannot assure you that, once a contract is fulfilled, the customer will purchase new products or services from us. We must, therefore, continually seek new customers in order to increase our revenue, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in doing so. 

13 

Many of our customers execute short-term purchase orders or contracts that allow our customers to terminate the agreement without significant penalties. 

Our contracts and purchase orders are separately negotiated with each of our customers and the terms vary widely. A majority of our customers execute only short-term purchase orders for a single system or a small number of systems at one time instead of long-term contracts for large-scale deployment of our systems. These contracts and purchase orders do not ensure that our customers will purchase any additional products beyond those specifically listed in the order. 

Moreover, since we often believe that these purchase orders may represent the early portion of longer-term customer programs, we often expend significant financial, personnel and operational resources to fulfill these orders. If our customers fail to purchase additional products to fulfill their programs, we may be unable to recover the costs we incur and our margins could suffer. 

In addition, our typical contracts are generally non-exclusive and contain provisions allowing our customers to terminate the agreement without significant penalties. Our contracts also may require certain shipment, delivery and installation commitments on our part. If we fail to meet these commitments, our customer contracts typically permit the customer to terminate the contract or impose monetary penalties on us. 

Our sales cycle is typically long and unpredictable, making it difficult to accurately predict inventory requirements, forecast revenues and control expenses. 

Our sales cycle can range from three to 18 months and varies by customer. The length of the sales cycle with a particular customer may be influenced by a number of factors, including the commitment of significant cash and other resources associated with the purchase, lengthy testing and evaluations, and regulatory and licensing requirements on the part of the customer. In addition, the emerging and evolving nature of the communication access market may cause prospective customers to delay their purchase decisions as they evaluate new and/or competing technologies, or wait for new products or technologies to come to market. We expect that our sales cycles will continue to be long and unpredictable, and, as the average order size for our products increases, our customers processes for approving purchases may become more complex and lead to an even longer sales cycle. Accordingly, it is difficult for us to anticipate the quarter in which particular sales may occur, to determine product shipment schedules and to provide our manufacturers and suppliers with accurate lead-time to ensure that they have sufficient inventory on hand to meet our orders. Therefore, our sales cycle impairs our ability to recognize and forecast revenues and control expenses. 

We make estimates relating to customer demand and errors in our estimates may have negative effects on our inventory levels, revenues and results of operations. 

We have historically been required to place firm orders or binding forecasts for products and components with our suppliers to ensure that we are able to meet our customers demands. These commitments to our suppliers may be placed up to six months prior to the anticipated delivery date based on our existing customer purchase commitments and our forecasts of future customer demand. Our sales process requires us to make multiple forecast assumptions relating to expected customer demand, each of which may introduce error into our estimates, causing excess inventory to accumulate or a lack of product supply when needed. If we overestimate customer demand, we may allocate resources to manufacturing products that we may not be able to sell when we expect or at all. As a result, we have sometimes had excess inventory, which has increased our net losses. Conversely, if we underestimate customer demand or if insufficient manufacturing capacity were available, we may lose revenue opportunities and market share and may damage our customer relationships.

Our results of operations may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates and tax rates and changes in tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate. 

We conduct a majority of our business operations outside the United States. In 2023 and 2022, our international sales (sales to customers located outside the United States which includes a small percentage of United States customers where the final destination of the equipment is outside of the United States) accounted for approximately 78 and 61 , respectively, of our total revenue. Our operations are subject to international business risks, including the need to convert currencies received for our products into currencies in which we purchase raw materials or pay for services, which could result in a gain or loss depending on fluctuations in exchange rates. We transact business in many foreign currencies, including New Israeli Shekels, British pounds and Japanese yen. We translate our local currency financial results into U.S. dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during the reporting period or the exchange rate at the end of that period. During times of a strengthening U.S. dollar, our reported international sales and earnings may be reduced because the local currency may translate into fewer U.S. dollars. Because of our global operations, we are exposed to fluctuations in global currency rates which may result in gains or losses on our financial statements. 

We are subject to income taxation in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous international jurisdictions. Tax laws, regulations, and administrative practices in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change, with or without notice, due to economic, political, and other conditions, and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. In particular, governmental agencies in domestic and international jurisdictions in which we and our affiliates do business, as well as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, have recently focused on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations. One example is in the area of base erosion and profit shifting , where profits are claimed to be earned for tax purposes in low-tax jurisdictions, or payments are made between affiliates from a jurisdiction with high tax rates to a jurisdiction with lower tax rates. There are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. In addition, our effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, such as intercompany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings, including earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we are subject to lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we are subject to higher statutory rates, the applicability of special tax regimes, losses incurred in jurisdictions in which we are not able to realize the related tax benefit, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, entry into new businesses and geographies, changes to our existing businesses and operations, acquisitions (including integrations) and investments and how they are financed, changes in our stock price, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, and changes in the relevant tax, accounting, and other laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations. 

We are also currently subject to audit in various jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us. Developments in an audit, litigation, or the relevant laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. 

In addition, we have recorded valuation allowances which result from our analysis of positive and negative evidence supporting the realization of tax benefits. Negative evidence includes a cumulative history of pre-tax operating losses in specific tax jurisdictions. Changes in valuation allowances have resulted in material fluctuations in our effective tax rate. Economic conditions may dictate the continued imposition of current valuation allowances and, potentially, the establishment of new valuation allowances and releases of existing valuation allowances. While significant valuation allowances remain, our effective tax rate will likely continue to experience significant fluctuations. 

15 

We rely on third-party manufacturers, which subjects us to risk of product delivery delays and reduced control over product costs and quality. 

We outsource the manufacturing of our products to third-party manufacturers. Purchases from these third-party manufacturers account for the most significant portion of our cost of revenues. Our reliance on third-party manufacturers reduces our control over the manufacturing process, including reduced control over quality, product costs and product supply and timing. From time to time, we have experienced and may in the future experience delays in shipments or issues concerning product quality from our third-party manufacturers. If any of our third-party manufacturers suffer interruptions, delays or disruptions in supplying our products, including by reason of natural disasters, work stoppages or capacity constraints, our ability to ship products to distributors and network operators would be delayed. Additionally, if any of our third-party manufacturers experience quality control problems in their manufacturing operations and our products do not meet network operators requirements, we could be required to cover the repair or replacement of any defective products. These delays or product quality issues could have an immediate and material adverse effect on our ability to fulfill orders and could have a negative impact on our operating results. In addition, such delays or issues with product quality could harm our reputation and our relationship with our channel partners. 

Our agreements do not typically obligate our third-party manufacturers to supply products to us in specific quantities or for an extended term, which could result in short notice to us of supply shortages and increases in the prices we are charged for manufacturing services. We believe that our orders may not represent a material portion of the total orders of our primary third-party manufacturers, and, as a result, fulfilling our orders may not be prioritized in the event they are constrained in their abilities or resources to fulfill all of their customer obligations in a timely manner. Although we provide demand forecasts to some of our third-party manufacturers, such forecasts are not generally binding and if we overestimate our requirements, some of our third-party manufacturers may assess charges, or we may have liabilities for excess inventory, each of which could negatively affect our gross margins. Conversely, because lead times for required materials and components vary significantly and depend on factors such as the specific supplier, contract terms and the demand for each component at a given time, if we underestimate our requirements, our third-party manufacturer may have inadequate materials and components required to produce our products. This could result in an interruption of the manufacturing of our products, delays in shipments and deferral or loss of revenues. For example, as a result of increased global demand for some components used in our products, particularly chipsets, some of our third-party manufacturers have experienced capacity shortages and have responded by allocating existing supply among their customers, including us. This capacity shortage coupled with an increase in demand for our affected products has resulted in supply shortages that have caused increased lead times for some of our products. We may suffer delays introducing new products to the market and in sales of existing products as a result of parts unavailability or shortages, resulting in loss or delay of revenue. 

If our third-party manufacturers experience financial, operational, manufacturing capacity or other difficulties, or experience shortages in required components, or if they are otherwise unable or unwilling to continue to manufacture our products in required volumes or at all, our supply may be disrupted, and we may be required to seek alternate manufacturers. It would be time-consuming and costly, and could be impracticable, to begin to use new manufacturers and such changes could cause significant interruptions in supply and could have an adverse impact on our ability to meet our scheduled product deliveries and may subsequently lead to the loss of sales, delayed revenues or an increase in our costs, which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results. 

16 

The inability of our supply chain to deliver certain key components could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Our products contain a significant number of components that we source globally, including from Vietnam and Malaysia. If our supply chain fails to deliver products to us in sufficient quality and quantity on a timely basis, we will be challenged to meet our customer order delivery timelines and could incur significant additional expenses for expedited freight and other related costs. Our supply chain has been, and may continue to be, adversely impacted by events outside of our control, including macroeconomic events, trade restrictions, economic recessions or natural occurrences. Certain of our customer contracts contain penalties for late or incomplete deliveries. These supply chain disruptions and delays may, in turn, cause us to be unable to make timely or complete deliveries to our customers, which may expose us to those penalties. Further, supply chain disruptions could result in longer lead times, inventory supply challenges and further increased costs, which could harm our ability to compete for future business. Accordingly, we remain subject to significant risks of supply chain disruptions or shortages, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

We must often establish and demonstrate the benefits of new and innovative offerings to customers, which may take time and significant efforts that may not ultimately prove successful. 

Many of our new and innovative products are complex and are focused on creating new revenue streams and/or new ways to create cost efficiencies. In many cases, it is necessary for us to educate existing and potential customers about the benefits and value of such new and innovative products, with no assurance that the customer will ultimately purchase them. The need to educate our customers increases the difficulty and time necessary to complete transactions, makes it more difficult to efficiently deploy limited resources, and creates risk that we will have invested in an opportunity that ultimately does not result in a sale. If we are unable to establish and demonstrate to customers the benefits and value of our new and innovative products and convert these efforts into sales, our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and prospects will be adversely affected. 

Our ability to sell our products is highly dependent on the quality of our support and services offerings, and our failure to offer high-quality support and services could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. 

Network operators rely on our products for critical applications and, as such, high-quality support is critical for the successful marketing and sale of our products. If we or our channel partners do not provide adequate support to network operators in deploying our products or in resolving post-deployment issues quickly, our reputation may be harmed and our ability to sell our products could be materially and adversely affected. 

We may not be able to detect errors or defects in our solutions until after full deployment and product liability claims by customers could result in substantial costs. 

Our solutions are sophisticated and are designed to be deployed in large and complex mobile networks that require a very high degree of reliability. Because of the nature of our solutions, they can only be fully tested when substantially deployed in very large networks with high volumes of subscriber traffic. Some of our customers have only recently begun to commercially deploy our solutions and they may discover errors or defects in the software or hardware, or the solutions may not operate as expected. Because we may not be able to detect these problems until full deployment, any errors or defects in our solutions could affect the functionality of the networks in which they are deployed, given the use of our solutions in business-critical applications. As a result, the time it may take us to rectify errors can be critical to our customers. 

Because the networks into which wireless service providers deploy our solutions require a very high degree of reliability, the consequences of an adverse effect on their networks, including any type of communications outage, can be very significant and costly. If any network problems were caused, or perceived to be caused, by errors or defects in our solutions, our reputation and the reputation of our solutions could be significantly damaged with respect to that customer and other customers. Such problems could lead to a loss of that customer or other customers. 

17 

If one of our solutions fails, we could also experience: payment of liquidated damages for performance failures; loss of, or delay in, revenue recognition; increased service, support, warranty, product replacement and product liability insurance costs, as well as a diversion of development resources; and costly and time-consuming legal actions by our customers, which could result in significant damages awards against us. Any of these events could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and prospects. 

Our international sales may be difficult and costly as a result of the political, economic and regulatory risks in those regions. 

Sales to customers based outside the United States have historically accounted for a majority of our revenues. In 2023 and 2022, our international sales (sales to customers located outside the United States which includes a small percentage of United States customers where the final destination of the equipment is outside of the United States) accounted for approximately 78 and 61 , respectively, of our total revenue. In many international markets, long-standing relationships between potential customers and their local suppliers and protective regulations, including local content requirements and type approvals, create barriers to entry. In addition, pursuing international opportunities may require significant investments for an extended period before returns on such investments, if any, are realized and such investments may result in expenses growing at a faster rate than revenues. The following risks inherent in international business could reduce the international demand for our products, decrease the prices at which we can sell our products internationally or disrupt our international operations, which could adversely affect our operations: 

the imposition of tariffs, duties, price controls or other restrictions on foreign currencies or trade barriers imposed by foreign countries; 

import or export controls, including licensing or product-certification requirements; 

unexpected changes in government policies or regulatory requirements in the United States or by foreign governments and delays in receiving licenses to operate; 

political instability and acts of war or terrorism; 

economic instability, including the impact of economic recessions; 

difficulty in staffing and managing geographically diverse operations; 

any limitation on our ability to enforce intellectual property rights or agreements in regions where the judicial legal systems may be less developed or less protective of intellectual property or contractual rights; 

capital and exchange control programs; 

challenges caused by distance, language and cultural differences; 

fluctuations in currency exchange rates; 

labor unrest; 

restrictions on the repatriation of cash; 

the nationalization of local industry; and 

potentially adverse tax consequences. 

18 

Our operations in Israel may be disrupted by political and military tensions in Israel and the Middle East. 

We conduct various activities in Israel, including research and development; design; and raw material procurement in Israel. Our operations could be negatively affected by the political and military tensions in Israel and the Middle East. 

Israel has been involved in a number of armed conflicts with its neighbors since 1948 and a state of hostility, varying in degree and intensity, has led to security and economic problems in Israel, most recently in light of the attack on Israel by Hamas on October 7, 2023. Conditions in Israel could, in the future, disrupt the development, manufacture and/or distribution of our products. 

If we lose Glenn Laxdal, our Chief Executive Officer, or any of our other executive officers, we may encounter difficulty replacing their expertise, which could impair our ability to implement our business plan successfully. 

We believe that our ability to implement our business strategy and our future success depends on the continued employment of our senior management team, in particular our chief executive officer, Glenn Laxdal. Our senior management team, who have extensive experience in our industry and are vital to maintaining some of our major customer relationships, may be difficult to replace. The loss of the technical knowledge and management and industry expertise of these key employees could make it difficult for us to execute our business plan effectively, could result in delays in new products being developed, could result in lost customers, and could cause a diversion of resources while we seek replacements. 

A material defect in our products that either delays the commencement of services or affects customer networks could seriously harm our credibility and our business, and we may not have sufficient insurance to cover any potential liability. 

Wireless network products are highly complex and frequently contain undetected software or hardware errors when first introduced or as new versions are released. We have detected and are likely to continue to detect errors and product defects in connection with new product releases and product upgrades. In the past, some of our products have contained defects that delayed the commencement of service by our customers. 

If our hardware or software contains undetected errors, we could experience: 

delayed or lost revenues and reduced market share due to adverse customer reactions; 

higher warranty costs and other costs and expenses due to the need to provide additional products and services to a customer at a reduced charge or at no charge; 

claims for substantial damages against us, regardless of our responsibility for any failure, which may lead to increased insurance costs; 

diversion of research and development resources to fix errors in the field; 

negative publicity regarding us and our products, which could adversely affect our ability to attract new customers; 

increased insurance costs; and 

diversion of management and development time and resources. 

Our general liability insurance coverage may not continue to be available on reasonable terms or in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims or our insurer may disclaim coverage as to any future claim. In addition, our products are often integrated with other network components. Incompatibilities between our products and these components could result in material harm to the service provider or its subscribers. These problems could adversely affect our cash position or our reputation and competitive position. 

19 

The mobile network industry investment levels fluctuate and are affected by many factors, including the economic environment and decisions made by wireless service providers and other customers regarding deployment of technology and their timing of purchases, and a downturn in investment levels could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 

The mobile network industry has experienced downturns in which wireless service providers and other customers substantially reduced their capital spending on new equipment. With the advent of 5G and the growth of private networks, we expect this market to grow in the coming years; however, the uncertainty surrounding global economic growth and the geopolitical situation may materially harm actual market conditions. Moreover, market conditions are subject to substantial fluctuation and could vary geographically and across technologies. Even if global conditions improve, conditions in the specific industry segments in which we participate may be weaker than in other segments. In that case, our revenue and operating results may be adversely affected. 

If capital expenditures by wireless service providers and other customers are weaker than we anticipate, our revenues, operating results and profitability may be adversely affected. The level of demand from operators and other customers who buy our products and services can vary over short periods of time, including from month to month. Due to this uncertainty, accurately forecasting revenues, results, and cash flow remains difficult. 

Risks associated with ongoing inflation and increasing oil and gas prices could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Inflation, which increased significantly during 2022 and 2023, has adversely affected us by increasing the costs of materials and labor needed to operate our business and could continue to adversely affect us in future periods. In addition the increase in oil and gas prices has adversely affected us with increased costs of transportation, heating premises and higher prices from our suppliers. We have increased certain of the sales prices of our products and services in response to these increased costs and, in the event inflation and oil and gas prices continue to increase, we may seek to further increase our sales prices in order to maintain satisfactory margins. However, such increases may result in customer pushback or attrition and be difficult or impossible in future periods, all of which may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, actions by governments to stimulate the economy may increase the risk of significant inflation, which may also have an adverse impact on our business or financial results. 

Our business and prospects depend on the strength of our brand. Failure to maintain and enhance our brand would harm our ability to increase sales by expanding our network of channel partners as well as the number of network operators who purchase our products. 

Maintaining and enhancing our brand is critical to expanding our base of channel partners and the number of network operators who purchase our products. Maintaining and enhancing our brand will depend largely on our ability to continue to develop products and solutions that provide the high quality at attractive economics sought by network operators. If we fail to promote, maintain and protect our brand successfully, our ability to sustain and expand our business and enter new markets will suffer. Our brand may be impaired by a number of factors, including product failure and counterfeiting. If we fail to maintain and enhance our brand, or if we need to incur unanticipated expenses to establish the brand in new markets, our operating results would be negatively affected. 

There is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and we need to raise additional funding to meet our obligations. We may not secure funding on a timely basis or on acceptable terms to satisfy our debt covenants or to attain profitable operations. 

We have not yet established an ongoing source of revenue sufficient to cover operating costs and allow us to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until we become profitable. Our ability to achieve the foregoing, which may be necessary to permit the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course of business, is uncertain and raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 

We may not secure funding to meet our obligations on a timely basis to attain profitable operations. Any additional liquidity we may need in order to meet our obligations on a timely basis or to attain profitable operations may not be available on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. 

20 

Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property 

We may not have adequate protection for our intellectual property, which may make it easier for others to misappropriate our technology and enable our competitors to sell competing products at lower prices and harm our business. 

Our success has historically relied in part on proprietary technology. We have used a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and contractual restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights associated with our products. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology, and we may not be able to detect unauthorized use or take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights. The laws of some foreign countries, particularly in Asia, do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States and the United Kingdom, and we may encounter substantial infringement problems in those countries. In addition, we do not file for patent protection in every country where we conduct business. In some countries where we do file for patent protection, we may choose not to maintain patent protection. In addition, we may not file for or maintain patent protection in a country from which we derive significant revenue. In instances where we have licensed intellectual property from third parties, we may have limited rights to institute actions against third parties for infringement of the licensed intellectual property or to defend any suit that challenges the validity of the licensed intellectual property. If we fail to protect adequately our intellectual property rights, or fail to do so under applicable law, it would be easier for our competitors to copy our products and sell competing products at lower prices, which would harm our business. 

Infringement claims are common in our industry and third parties, including competitors, have and could in the future assert infringement claims against us or our customers that we are obligated to indemnify. 

Our industry is highly competitive and our technologies are complex. Companies file patent applications and obtain patents covering these technologies frequently and maintain programs to protect their intellectual property portfolios. In addition, patent holding companies (including non-practicing entities regularly bring claims against telecommunication equipment companies, often attempting to extract royalty, licensing or other settlements. 

Our solutions are technically complex and compete with the products and solutions of significantly larger companies. Our likelihood of being subject to infringement claims may increase as a result of our real or perceived success, as the number of competitors in our industry grows and as we add functionality to our solutions. We have previously received and may in the future receive communications from third parties alleging that we are or may be infringing their intellectual property rights. The visibility we receive from being a public company may result in a greater number of such allegations. 

We have also agreed, and expect to continue to agree, to indemnify our customers for certain expenses or liabilities resulting from claimed infringement of intellectual property rights of third parties with respect to our solutions and software. We have received indemnity demands from customers in the past and may receive such other claims in the future. In the case of infringement claims against these customers, we could be required to indemnify them for losses resulting from such claims or to refund license fees they have paid to us. If a customer asserts a claim for indemnification against us, we could incur significant costs and reputational harm disputing it. If we do not succeed in disputing it, we could face substantial liability, particularly as these liabilities do not typically have caps or specific limits and our insurance coverage relating to any such liabilities generally would be very limited. 

Regardless of the merit of third-party claims that we or our customers infringe their rights, these claims could be time consuming and costly to defend, divert management s attention and resources, require us to make costly or difficult changes to our designs, cause us to cease producing, licensing or using software or solutions, require us to pay damages for past infringement, potentially including treble damages, or enter into royalty or licensing agreements, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all, or any combination of, or all of, these actions. 

21 

We may be subject to damages resulting from claims that our employees or contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employees or other parties. 

We could be subject to claims that we, or our employees or contractors, have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of our competitors or other parties. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending against such claims, a court could order us to pay substantial damages and prohibit us from using technologies or features that are important to our products, if such technologies or features are found to incorporate or be derived from the trade secrets or other proprietary information of these parties. In addition, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. A loss of key personnel or their work product could hamper or prevent our ability to develop, market and support potential products or enhancements, which could materially and adversely affect our business. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, such litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management. 

We use open-source software in our products that may subject our firmware to general release or require us to re-engineer our products and the firmware contained therein, which may cause harm to our business. 

We incorporate open-source software into our products. Use and distribution of open-source software may entail greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open-source licensors generally do not provide warranties or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the software code. Some open-source licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the open-source software and that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of a particular open-source license or other license granting third parties certain rights of further use. If we combine our proprietary firmware or other software with open-source software in a certain manner, we could, under certain of the open-source licenses, be required to release our proprietary source code publicly or license such source code on unfavorable terms or at no cost. Open-source license terms relating to the disclosure of source code in modifications or derivative works to the open-source software are often ambiguous and few if any courts in jurisdictions applicable to us have interpreted such terms. As a result, many of the risks associated with usage of open-source software cannot be eliminated, and could, if not properly addressed, negatively affect our business. 

If we were found to have inappropriately used open source software, we may be required to release our proprietary source code, re-engineer our firmware or other software, discontinue the sale of our products in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis or take other remedial action that may divert resources away from our development efforts, any of which could adversely increase our expenses and delay our ability to release our products for sale. We could also be subject to similar conditions or restrictions should there be any changes in the licensing terms of the open-source software incorporated into our products. 

22 

Risks Related to Laws and Regulations 

Changes in telecommunications regulation or delays in receiving licenses could adversely affect many of our customers and may lead to lower sales. 

Many of our customers are subject to extensive regulation as communications service providers, including with respect to the availability of radio frequencies for two-way broadband communications. Each country has different regulations and regulatory processes for wireless communications equipment and for the uses of radio frequencies. Some of our products operate in license-exempt bands, while others operate in licensed bands in different jurisdictions. In addition, changes in laws or regulations that adversely affect existing and potential customers could lead them to delay, reduce or cancel expenditures on communications access systems, which actions would harm our business. In the past, anticipated customer orders have been postponed because of regulatory issues in various countries. The resolution of those issues can be lengthy, and the outcome can be unpredictable. Some of the orders we receive from customers are contingent upon their receipt of licenses from regulators, the timing of which can often be uncertain. Depending on the jurisdiction, the receipt of licenses by our customers may occur, if at all, a year or more after they initially seek those licenses. 

At present there are few laws or regulations that specifically address our business of providing communications access equipment. However, future regulation may include access or settlement charges or tariffs that could impose economic burdens on our customers and our company. We are unable to predict the impact, if any, that future legislation, judicial decisions or regulations in the countries in which we do business will have on our business, operating results and financial condition. 

If we were not able to satisfy data protection, security, privacy and other government- and industry-specific requirements or regulations, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed. 

Personal privacy, data protection, information security and telecommunications-related laws and regulations have been widely adopted in the United States, Europe and other jurisdictions where we offer our products. The regulatory frameworks for these matters, including privacy, data protection and information security matters, is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. We expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws, regulations and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection, information security and telecommunications services in the United States, the European Union and other jurisdictions in which we operate or may operate, and we cannot yet determine the impact such future laws, regulations and standards may have on our business. For example, the European Commission adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (the GDPR ), effective in May 2018, that supersedes prior EU data protection legislation, imposes more stringent EU data protection requirements and imposes greater penalties for noncompliance. Additionally, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the CCPA ), which took effect on January 1, 2020, and broadly defines personal information, gives California residents expanded privacy rights and protections and provides for civil penalties for violations. Additional states as well as other countries around the world also have or are in the process of enacting or amending data protection, security, and privacy regulations. We also expect that existing laws, regulations and standards may be interpreted in new manners in the future. Future laws, regulations, standards and other obligations, and changes in the interpretation of existing laws, regulations, standards and other obligations could require us to modify our products, restrict our business operations, increase our costs and impair our ability to maintain and grow our channel partner base and increase our revenues. The cost of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, the GDPR, CCPA and other new privacy laws may limit the use and adoption of our products and services and could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

Although we work to comply with applicable privacy and data security laws and regulations, industry standards, contractual obligations and other legal obligations, those laws, regulations, standards and obligations are evolving and may be modified, interpreted and applied in an inconsistent manner from one jurisdiction to another, and may conflict with one another. As such, we cannot assure ongoing compliance with all such laws, regulations, standards and obligations. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with applicable laws, regulations, standards or obligations, or any actual or suspected security incident, whether or not resulting in unauthorized access to, or acquisition, release or transfer of personally identifiable information or other data, may result in governmental enforcement actions and prosecutions, private litigation, fines and penalties or adverse publicity, and could cause channel partners to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business. 

23 

Regulations affecting broadband infrastructure could damage demand for our products. 

Laws and regulations governing the Internet are emerging but remain largely unsettled, even in the areas where there has been some legislative action. Regulations may focus on, among other things, assessing access or settlement charges, or imposing tariffs or regulations based on the characteristics and quality of products, either of which could restrict our business or increase our cost of doing business. Government regulatory policies are likely to continue to have a major impact on the pricing of existing and new network services and, therefore, are expected to affect demand for those services and the communications products, including our products, supporting those services. There will likely be future government regulatory policies relating to migration to the cloud as these technologies become more prevalent in the U.S. and globally. 

Any changes to existing laws or the adoption of new regulations by federal or state regulatory authorities or any legal challenges to existing laws or regulations affecting Internet Protocol IP networks could materially adversely affect the market for our products. Moreover, customers may require us, or we may otherwise deem it necessary or advisable, to alter our products to address actual or anticipated changes in the regulatory environment. Our inability to alter our products or address any regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 

We are subject to governmental export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international markets and subject us to liability if we are not in compliance with applicable laws. 

Our technology and products are subject to export control and import laws and regulations, including the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, U.S. customs regulations, the economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department s Office of Foreign Assets Controls, and applicable U.K. export and import laws and regulations. Exports, re-exports and transfers of our products and technology must be made in compliance with these laws and regulations. U.S. and U.K. export control laws and economic sanctions include a prohibition on the shipment of certain products and technology to embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments and persons. We take precautions to prevent our products and technology from being shipped to, downloaded by or otherwise transferred to applicable sanctions targets, but our products could be shipped to those targets by our channel partners despite such precautions. If our products are shipped to or downloaded by sanctioned targets in the future in violation of applicable export laws, we could be subject to government investigations, penalties and reputational harm. Certain of our products incorporate encryption technology and may be exported, re-exported or transferred only with the required applicable export license from the U.S. or the U.K. or through an export license exception. 

If we fail to comply with applicable export and import regulations, customs and trade regulations, and economic sanctions and other laws, we could be subject to substantial civil and criminal penalties, including fines and incarceration for responsible employees and managers, and the possible loss of export or import privileges as well as harm our reputation and indirectly have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, if our channel partners fail to comply with applicable export and import regulations, customs regulations, and economic and sanctions and other laws in connection with our products and technology, then we may also be adversely affected, through reputational harm and penalties. Obtaining the necessary export license for a particular sale may be time-consuming, may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities and approval is not guaranteed. 

Failure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act FCPA ), the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 Bribery Act and similar laws associated with our activities outside the United States could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences. 

As a substantial portion of our revenue is, and we expect will continue to be, from jurisdictions outside of the United States, we face significant risks if we fail to comply with the FCPA, the Bribery Act and other laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payment to governments and their officials and political parties by us and other business entities for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. In many countries, particularly in countries with developing economies, some of which represent significant markets for us, it may be a local custom that businesses operating in such countries engage in business practices that are prohibited by the FCPA, the Bribery Act or other laws and regulations. Our management may not be effective at preventing all potential FCPA, Bribery Act or other violations. We also cannot guarantee the compliance by our channel partners, resellers, suppliers and agents with applicable U.S. laws, including the FCPA, the Bribery Act or other applicable non-U.S. laws. Therefore, there can be no assurance that none of our employees or agents will take actions in violation of applicable laws, for which we may be ultimately held responsible. As a result of our focus on managing our growth, our development of infrastructure designed to identify FCPA and Bribery Act matters and monitor compliance is at an early stage. Any violation of the FCPA or the Bribery Act could result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, which could have a material and adverse effect on our reputation, business, operating results and financial condition.

Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited. 

As of December 31, 2023, we had 32.0 million of U.S. federal and 32.0 million of state net operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income. Of the 32.0 million in U.S. federal operating loss carryforwards, 9.9 million will be carried forward indefinitely for U.S. federal tax purposes and 22.0 million will expire between 2024 and 2039. The 32.0 million in state operating loss carryforwards will expire between 2024 and 2044. It is possible that we will not generate taxable income in time to use these net operating loss carryforwards before their expiration or at all. In addition, the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards and certain tax credits may be subject to significant limitations under Section 382 and Section 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), respectively, and similar provisions of state law. Under those sections of the Code, if a corporation undergoes an ownership change, the corporation s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change attributes to offset its post-change income or tax may be limited. In general, an ownership change will occur if there is a cumulative change in our ownership by 5-percent shareholders that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. To the extent we are not able to offset future taxable income with our net operating losses, our cash flows may be adversely affected. 

General Risk Factors 

Our business is subject to the risks of earthquakes, fires, floods, military actions and other natural catastrophic events, global pandemics and interruptions by man-made problems, such as terrorism. Material disruptions of our business or information systems resulting from these events could adversely affect our operating results. 

A significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, fire, flood, hurricane or significant power outage or other similar events, such as infectious disease outbreaks or pandemic events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results. Natural disasters, acts of terrorism or war could cause disruptions in our operations, our or our customers or channel partners businesses, our suppliers or the economy as a whole. We also rely on information technology systems to communicate among our workforce and with third parties. Any disruption to our communications, whether caused by a natural disaster or by manmade problems, such as power disruptions, could adversely affect our business. To the extent that any such disruptions result in delays or cancellations of orders or impede our suppliers ability to timely deliver product components, or the deployment of our products, our business, operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected. 

Interruption or failure of our information technology and communications systems could impact our ability to effectively provide our products and services. 

We utilize data connectivity to monitor performance and timely capture opportunities to enhance performance and functionality. The availability and effectiveness of our services depend on the continued operation of information technology and communications systems. Our systems will be vulnerable to damage or interruption from, among others, physical theft, fire, terrorist attacks, natural disasters, power loss, war, telecommunications failures, viruses, denial or degradation of service attacks, ransomware, social engineering schemes, insider theft or misuse or other attempts to harm our systems, and we have previously experienced denial or degradation of service attacks and ransomware attacks. We utilize reputable third-party service providers or vendors, and these providers could also be vulnerable to harms similar to those that could damage our systems, including sabotage and intentional acts of vandalism causing potential disruptions. Some of our systems are not fully redundant, and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. Any problems with our third-party providers could result in lengthy interruptions in our business. In addition, our services and functionality are highly technical and complex technology which may contain errors or vulnerabilities that could result in interruptions in our business or the failure of our systems. 

25 

We are subject to cybersecurity risks to operational systems, security systems, infrastructure, integrated software in our 4G and 5G products and customer data processed by us or third-party vendors or suppliers and any material failure, weakness, interruption, cyber event, incident or breach of security could prevent us from effectively operating our business. 

We are at risk for interruptions, outages and breaches of: operational systems, including business, financial, accounting, product development, data processing or production processes, owned by us or our third-party vendors or suppliers; facility security systems, owned by us or our third-party vendors or suppliers; in-product technology owned by us or our third-party vendors or suppliers; the integrated software in our products; or customer data that we process or our third-party vendors or suppliers process on our behalf. Such cyber incidents have previously and in the future could materially disrupt operational systems; result in loss of intellectual property, trade secrets or other proprietary or competitively sensitive information; compromise certain information of customers, employees, suppliers, drivers or others; jeopardize the security of our facilities; or affect the performance of in-product technology and the integrated software in our products. A cyber incident could be caused by disasters, insiders (through inadvertence or with malicious intent) or malicious third parties (including nation-states or nation-state supported actors) using sophisticated, targeted methods to circumvent firewalls, encryption and other security defenses, including hacking, fraud, trickery or other forms of deception. The techniques used by cyber attackers change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time. Although we maintain information technology measures designed to protect ourselves against intellectual property theft, data breaches and other cyber incidents, such measures have not successfully detected or prevented all previous cyber incidents and will require updates and improvements, and we cannot guarantee that such measures will be adequate to detect, prevent or mitigate future cyber incidents. 

For example, in December 2021, we experienced a ransomware incident that impacted the availability of certain systems within our computer network. In response to this incident, we secured digital assets within our computer systems, immediately commenced an investigation with assistance from an outside cybersecurity firm and were able to successfully restore our systems, without paying a ransom, after working to get the systems back up as quickly as possible. Despite these actions, we experienced some delays and disruptions to our business, primarily with respect to employee access to business applications and e-mail service. In addition, in January 2022, we experienced a denial- of-service attack on our e-mail service. We were able to restore e-mail service after working to do so as quickly as possible. In connection with these incidents, we have incurred certain incremental one-time costs of 0.1 million related to consultants, experts and data recovery efforts, net of insurance recoveries, and expect to incur additional costs related to cybersecurity protections in the future. Although we have not been the subject of any legal proceedings involving these incidents, it is possible that we could be the subject of claims from persons alleging that they suffered damages from these incidents. We also are in the process of implementing a variety of measures to further enhance our cybersecurity protections and minimize the impact of any future attack. However, cyber threats are constantly evolving, and there can be no guarantee that a future cyber event will not occur. 

In addition, the implementation, maintenance, segregation and improvement of these systems requires significant management time, support and cost. Moreover, there are inherent risks associated with developing, improving, expanding and updating current systems, including the disruption of our data management, procurement, production execution, finance, supply chain and sales and service processes. These risks may affect our ability to manage our data and inventory, procure parts or supplies or produce, sell, deliver and service our products, adequately protect our intellectual property or achieve and maintain compliance with, or realize available benefits under, applicable laws, regulations and contracts. We cannot be sure that the systems upon which we rely, including those of our third-party vendors or suppliers, will be effectively implemented, maintained or expanded as planned. If we do not successfully implement, maintain or expand these systems as planned, our operations may be disrupted, our ability to accurately and timely report our financial results could be impaired, and deficiencies may arise in our internal control over financial reporting, which may impact our ability to certify our financial results. 

26 

Moreover, our proprietary information or intellectual property has previously and in the future could be compromised or misappropriated and our reputation may be adversely affected. For example, through our investigation of the December 2021 incident referenced above, we discovered that the individuals responsible for this incident acquired certain files from our servers. If our systems do not operate as we expect them to, we have previously been and may in the future be required to expend significant resources to make corrections or find alternative sources for performing these functions. 

A significant cyber incident could harm our reputation, cause us to breach our contracts with other parties or subject us to regulatory actions or litigation, any of which could materially affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. In addition, our insurance coverage for cyber-attacks may not be sufficient to cover all the losses we may experience as a result of a cyber-incident. 

We may identify material weaknesses in the future, or fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, which may result in material misstatements of our consolidated financial statements or cause us to fail to meet our periodic reporting obligations. 

In connection with the audit of our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to the cut-off of revenue recognition on products shipped to customers, which was remediated as of December 31, 2022. 

However, if in the future we were to conclude that our internal controls over financial reporting are not effective, we cannot be certain as to the timing of completion of our evaluation, testing and remediation actions or their effect on our operations because there is presently no precedent available by which to measure compliance adequacy. As a consequence, we may not be able to complete any necessary remediation process in time to meet our deadline for compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Also, there can be no assurance that we will not identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal controls in connection with evaluating our compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The presence of material weaknesses could result in financial statement errors which, in turn, could require us to restate our operating results. 

If we are unable to conclude that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in our operating results, our stock price could decline and we may be subject to litigation or regulatory enforcement actions. In addition, if we are unable to meet the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we may not be able to maintain listing on the NYSE American.

Cybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy 

Information about cybersecurity risks and our risk management processes is collected, analyzed and considered as part of our overall enterprise risk management program, which we endeavor to align with industry standards. We have key Company policies and practices that directly or indirectly relate to cybersecurity matters, including policies and practices relating to antivirus protection, remote access, multifactor authentication, restricted access based upon business need and confidentiality of information, as well as procedures designed to reduce phishing, increase employee awareness of phishing attempts and other activities. The key elements of our efforts to identify, prevent, mitigate, and remediate cybersecurity risks and incidents through our cybersecurity risk management program include: 

We collect and analyze information about cybersecurity risks as part of our risk management program and monitor and discuss public alerts, threat levels, trends and remediation. 

27 

All employees receive periodic cybersecurity training designed to educate concerning the recognition of cybersecurity threats. 

Employees are obligated under the terms of our IT Appropriate Use Policy to protect IT assets from attack and to maintain proper control of access to IT systems and passwords. 

We use various security tools, including internal reporting and monitoring, to identify vulnerabilities in our products and systems. We use industry leading products and services within our IT environment to optimize security and under vendor contracts. 

Regular system updates and patching are done to protect our hardware and software against security vulnerabilities. 

In certain limited situations we allow third party suppliers to access certain areas of our systems. In such cases third party access is strictly minimized and supervised to optimize security and control. 

We have controls and procedures in place for prompt escalation of cybersecurity incidents and periodically evaluate and update contingency planning, including capability to recover in the event that a portion of our information resources were to be unavailable due to a cybersecurity incident. 

We conduct penetration testing to test our defenses and monitor threat levels. 

We partner with a third-party security consultant to review our incident response process and ensure our programs align with industry standards. 

Risk Assessment 

We experience cyber-attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to our systems on a regular basis, and we anticipate continuing to be subject to such attempts. Despite our implementation of security measures, (i) our products and services, and (ii) the servers, data centers, and cloud-based solutions on which our and third-party data is stored, are vulnerable to cyber-attacks, data breaches, malware, and disruptions from unauthorized access, tampering or other theft or misuse, including by employees, malicious actors or inadvertent error. We face certain ongoing risks from cybersecurity threats that, if realized, are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our operations, business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. 

Cybersecurity Governance 

Cybersecurity risk is part of management s risk oversight, although periodic reports are made to the Board of Directors of management s implementation and monitoring of our cybersecurity risks programs. Our Board of Directors addresses our cybersecurity risk management as part of its general oversight function. Management will update the Board, as necessary, regarding any significant cybersecurity incidents should they occur, so that decisions regarding public disclosure and reporting of such incidents can be made by management and the Board in a timely manner. 

Our information technology team, which has overall responsibility for cybersecurity, is led by our Vice President, Global IT, who, has a Masters Degree in Philosophy, Politics and Economics from Oxford University and 32 years of experience in information technology management, and who reports to our Senior Vice President and CFO. Our cybersecurity management team draws from expertise in our information technology, information security, finance, legal, impacted product teams or product management personnel and other departments as needed. This team is responsible for assessing and managing our material risks from cybersecurity threats and our overall cybersecurity risk management program and supervises both our internal cybersecurity personnel and any retained external cybersecurity consultants.

Pursuant to the RSA, the Company commenced the solicitation of votes on the Prepackaged Plan (the Solicitation on March 30, 2024. In connection with the Solicitation, the Plan and Disclosure Statement were distributed to certain creditors of the Company that are entitled to vote on the Plan. 

The RSA may be mutually terminated by the Required Consenting Senior Secured Creditors and each Company Party. The RSA will automatically terminate upon the earlier of the Plan Effective Date or 180 days after the date on which the Company Parties commenced their Chapter 11 Cases (the Outside Date provided, that if the Plan Effective Date shall not have occurred by the Outside Date solely as a result of the failure to receive all necessary or advisable regulatory approvals by the Outside Date, the Outside Date shall automatically extend to the earlier of three business days following the receipt of all necessary or advisable regulatory approvals or 210 days after the date on which the Company Parties commenced their Chapter 11 Cases. Moreover, the Required Consenting Senior Secured Creditors, the Required Consenting Subordinated Creditors and the Company Parties each have termination rights if certain conditions are not met. 

DIP Credit Facility 

In connection with the Chapter 11
Cases, the Debtors entered into a Senior Secured Superpriority Debtor-in-Possession Term Loan Credit Agreement, dated April 8,
2024 (the Initial DIP Credit Agreement ), with DBFIP ANI LLC, as administrative and collateral agent (the DIP
Administrative Agent ), and the lenders from time to time party thereto (collectively, the DIP Lenders ), and a
Security Agreement, dated April 8, 2024 (the DIP Security Agreement ), with DBFIP ANI LLC, as collateral agent.
The DIP Lenders are also (i) holders or affiliates, partners or investors of holders under the Company s senior secured
convertible notes sold pursuant to the Senior Secured Convertible Note Purchase and Guarantee Agreement, dated as of July 30,
2021 (as amended, restated, amended and restated, supplemented, modified or replaced, extended or refinanced from time to time), by
and among the Company, certain of its subsidiaries as guarantors, the purchasers party thereto and DBFIP ANI LLC, as collateral

DIP Facility will bear interest at either (i) the Base Rate (as defined in the DIP Credit Agreement) plus 10.00 per annum, or (ii)
the Adjusted Term SOFR (as defined in the DIP Credit Agreement) plus 11.00 per annum. Interest on the DIP Facility is payable
in-kind.

Bankruptcy Court approval, to pay certain fees, in connection with the Initial DIP Facility, including (i) an administration fee in
an amount equal to 50,000 per annum, payable-in-kind, (ii) a 3 Commitment Premium (as defined in the DIP Credit Agreement),
payable in-kind, and (iii) a 3 Exit Premium (as defined in the DIP Credit Agreement), earned upon the repayment or maturity of all
or a portion of the DIP Facility, and payable on the repaid or maturing amounts. The Commitment Premium and the Exit Premium do not
apply to the New DIP Loans. 

The DIP Credit Agreement includes milestones, representations and warranties, covenants applicable to the Debtors, and events of default. If an event of default under the DIP Credit Agreement occurs, the DIP Administrative Agent may, among other things, permanently reduce any remaining commitments and declare the outstanding obligations under the DIP Credit Agreement to be immediately due and payable. 

The DIP Credit Agreement has a stated maturity date of October 8, 2024 (the DIP Stated Maturity Date ). The DIP Credit Agreement will also terminate and all obligations thereunder will become due on the date that is the earliest of the following (i) the DIP Stated Maturity Date, (ii) the consummation of any plan of reorganization under the Chapter 11 Cases, (iii) the consummation of a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all assets of the Debtors, taken as a whole, under section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code and (iv) the date of acceleration following the occurrence of an Event of Default (as defined in the DIP Credit Agreement). 

On July 23, 2024, the Bankruptcy Court granted
the Company s motion to approve the DIP Facility Amendment No. 1 to provide up to 5.0 million in additional funding to facilitate
continued operations until the Company receives required regulatory approvals and is able to emerge from bankruptcy and close the Restructuring
Transactions. 

Delisting 

In connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, on April 1, 2024, the staff of NYSE Regulation announced its determination to commence proceedings to delist the Common Stock from NYSE American, and trading of the Common Stock was suspended immediately. On April 10, 2024, the staff of NYSE Regulation filed a Form 25-NSE with the SEC to report the delisting of the Common Stock from trading on the NYSE American. 

The Company intends to file a Form 15 with the SEC to suspend the Company s public reporting obligations with the SEC under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act. 

Confirmed Plan 

All creditors entitled to vote on the Prepackaged
Plan, and who did vote on the Prepackaged Plan, have voted to accept the Prepackaged Plan. The Debtors communicated with various interested parties and resolved all comments on
the proposed Prepackaged Plan without changing the key terms outlined above. As part of that process, the Debtors entered into a term
sheet with Gogo Inc. which outlines the principal terms and conditions for a new revolving line of credit in the aggregate principal
amount of 20.0 million (the New Revolving Line of Credit ), and the assumption of certain commercial contracts between
the Debtors and Gogo Inc. (and its affiliates). The New Revolving Line of Credit is expected to be undrawn as of the Plan Effective Date. 

34 

A hearing on confirmation of the proposed Prepackaged Plan took place before the Bankruptcy Court on June 28, 2024, at which the Bankruptcy Court confirmed the Prepackaged Plan . 

Gogo Agreements 

On or about April 12, 2024, Gogo Business Aviation
LLC Gogo notified the Company of its assertion that the Company was allegedly in default under certain contracts with
Gogo (the Existing Gogo Contracts ), which the Company disputes. Following negotiations, and without any admission
or acknowledgment from Legacy Airspan as to the accuracy or validity of any purported default or event of default under the Existing
Gogo Contracts, Legacy Airspan and Gogo resolved the dispute by entering into a Waiver and Omnibus Amendment to Airspan/Gogo Agreements
dated as of June 27, 2024 (the Gogo Agreement with respect to the Existing Gogo Contracts. Under the Gogo Agreement,
Gogo agreed to waive its existing alleged claims under the Existing Gogo Contracts, conditional upon certain specified events not occurring
after the Plan Effective Date. Additionally, the parties agreed to modify certain terms of the Existing Gogo Contracts, including
certain reporting obligations, observation rights, and performance dates. The amendments and conditional waivers under the Gogo
Agreement are not effective until the Plan Effective Date.

The Transaction closed on August 11, 2023. 

Restructuring Activities 

In the second quarter of 2023, as part of a strategic review of our operations, the Company implemented a cost reduction and restructuring program (the 2023 Restructuring Program ). The 2023 Restructuring Program was primarily comprised of entering into severance and termination agreements with employees. Formal announcements to the relevant employees were made in May, June and July 2023 and activities continued throughout the third and fourth quarter of 2023. The payments related to severance costs were completed by March 31, 2024, and the payments related to the building costs should be completed by December 31, 2024. 

The Company also recorded an inventory impairment charge of 12.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2023, which is included in cost of revenues in the consolidated statement of operations. A charge of 10.1 million relates to certain product initiatives that were eliminated or reduced as a result of the headcount reductions in the 2023 Restructuring Program and 1.9 million relates to an accrual for inventory on order for these eliminated or reduced product initiatives. 

Global Economic Conditions 

We have experienced supply chain disruptions and inflationary impacts across our businesses, driven by the impact of regional conflicts, economic sanctions, and general macroeconomic factors. These factors have increased our operating costs. While we are taking actions to respond to the supply chain disruptions, inflationary environment, and global demand dynamics, we may not be able to enact these measures in a timely manner, or the measures may not be sufficient to offset the increase in costs, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. 

37 

Cybersecurity Incidents 

In January 2022, we experienced a denial-of-service attack on our e-mail service. We were able to restore e-mail service after working to do so as quickly as possible. 

In connection with this incident, we have incurred certain incremental one-time costs of 0.1 million related to consultants, experts and data recovery efforts, net of insurance recoveries, and expect to incur additional costs related to cybersecurity protections in the future. We are in the process of implementing a variety of measures to further enhance our cybersecurity protections and minimize the impact of any future attack. However, cyber threats are constantly evolving, and there can be no guarantee that a future cyber event will not occur. 

Going Concern Update 

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared and are presented assuming the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. We will need to secure additional funding to meet our operations on a timely basis, to satisfy our debt covenants and, ultimately, to attain profitable operations. The Company filed Chapter 11 on March 31, 2024. The Bankruptcy Court confirmed the Company s Prepackaged Plan on June 28, 2024. 

In addition, as discussed in Notes 14 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company s senior term loan and Convertible Notes require certain financial covenants to be met. We were not in compliance with the minimum liquidity covenant under the Fortress Credit Agreement and the Fortress Convertible Note Agreement at all times from November 29, 2022, which was an event of default under those agreements for which a waiver was obtained. We also did not make cash payments of principal and interest under the Fortress Credit Agreement and the Fortress Convertible Note on September 30, October 31, November 30, and December 31 within any grace period applicable thereto, for which we obtained a deferral of such payments. We also obtained a prospective waiver of compliance with the minimum liquidity covenant, the minimum last twelve-month EBITDA covenant and the minimum last twelve-month revenue covenant under the Fortress Credit Agreement and the Fortress Convertible Note Agreement as of the December 31, 2023 quarterly measurement date. 

In order to address the need to satisfy the Company s continuing obligations and realize its long-term strategy, management has taken several steps and is considering additional actions to improve its operating and financial results, including the following: 

focusing the Company s efforts to increase sales in additional geographic markets; 

continuing to develop 5G product offerings that will expand the market for the Company s products; 

continuing to improve days sales outstanding to provide additional liquidity; and 

continuing to implement cost reduction initiatives to reduce non-strategic costs in operations and expand the Company s labor force in lower cost geographies, with headcount reductions in higher cost geographies. 

There can be no assurance that the above actions
will be successful. Without additional financing or capital, the Company s current cash balance would be insufficient to satisfy
repayment demands from its lenders if the lenders elect to declare the senior term loan and the senior secured convertible notes due
prior to the maturity date. There is no assurance that the new or renegotiated financing will be available, or that if available, will
have satisfactory terms. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within
one year after the date that these financial statements are issued. If the Company emerges from bankruptcy under the currently proposed
Restructuring Support Agreement RSA ), this is expected to provide adequate equity financing and eliminate all existing
senior and subordinated debt. In addition, the Company expects to have access to a 20.0 million revolving line of credit. The accompanying
consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying
amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

How We Assess the Performance of Our Business 

In assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of performance and financial measures. The key indicators of the financial condition and operating performance of our business are revenue, cost of revenue, research and development, sales and marketing, general and administrative, interest expense, income taxes and net income. To further help us assess our performance with these key indicators, we use Adjusted Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization Adjusted EBITDA as a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and expanded insight to measure our revenue and cost performance as a supplement to our GAAP consolidated financial statements. See the Adjusted EBITDA sections below for a reconciliation to net income (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP measure. 

Revenues 

We derive the majority of our revenues from sales of our networking products, with the remaining revenue generated from software licenses and service fees relating to non-recurring engineering, product maintenance contracts and professional services for our products. We sell our products and services to end customers, distributors and resellers. Products and services may be sold separately or in bundled packages. 

Our top three customers accounted for 68 and 61 of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 

Our sales outside the U.S. and North America accounted for 78 and 57 of our total revenue in the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The following table identifies the percentage of our revenue by customer geographic region in the periods identified.

Note that the year ended December 31, 2023 sales by geographic region included Mimosa sales through August 11, 2023 which affects the comparability to the sales by geographic region for the year ended December 31, 2022. 

Cost of Revenues 

Cost of revenues consists of component and material costs, direct labor costs, warranty costs, royalties, overhead related to manufacture of our products and customer support costs. Our gross margin is affected by changes in our product mix both because our gross margin on software and services is higher than the gross margin on base station related equipment, and because our different product lines generate different margins. In addition, our gross margin is affected by changes in the average selling price of our systems and volume discounts granted to significant customers. We expect the average selling prices of our existing products to continue to decline and we intend to continue to implement product cost reductions and develop and introduce new products or product enhancements in an effort to maintain or increase our gross margins. Further, we may derive an increasing proportion of our revenue from the sale of our integrated systems through distribution channels. Revenue derived from these sales channels typically carries a lower gross margin than direct sales. 

39 

Operating Expenses 

Research and Development 

Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for personnel and expenses for design, development, testing facilities and equipment depreciation. These expenses also include costs associated with product development efforts, including consulting fees and prototyping costs from initial product concept to manufacture and production as well as sub-contracted development work. We expect to continue to make substantial investments in research and development. 

Sales and Marketing 

Sales and marketing expenses consist of salaries and related costs for personnel, sales commissions, consulting and agent s fees and expenses for advertising, travel, technical assistance, trade shows, and promotional and demonstration materials. We expect to continue to incur substantial expenditures related to sales and marketing activities. 

General and Administrative 

General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for our personnel, audit, professional and consulting fees and facilities costs. 

Restructuring costs 

Restructuring costs consist primarily of employee termination benefits. 

Non-Operating Expenses 

Interest Expense, Net 

Interest expense consists primarily of interest associated with the Convertible Notes, two subordinated loan facilities and our senior secured credit facility, which consisted of a term loan and revolving credit facility. Interest on the term loan was determined based on the highest of the LIBOR Rate (or, subsequent to the transition to SOFR, the SOFR Rate), commercial lending rate of the collateral agent and federal funds rate, plus an applicable margin. Interest on the revolving credit facility is based on the LIBOR Rate (or, subsequent to the transition to SOFR the SOFR Rate) plus an applicable margin. On May 18, August 11, November 14, and December 22, 2023, we amended the terms of our credit facility with Fortress and the agreement governing the Convertible Notes. On May 18, 2023, we amended and restated the Convertible Notes. (See Notes 12 and 13 of the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion on these agreements.) 

Loss on Extinguishment of Debt 

The senior term loan and convertible
debt were amended with the May 2023 Fortress Credit Agreement Amendment and the May 2023 Fortress Convertible Note
Agreement Amendment. Due to the increased interest rates and maturity amounts, the modification of terms was accounted for as debt
extinguishment and all fees from the prior agreement were expensed as loss on extinguishment of debt in the consolidated statement
of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

Change in fair value of warrant liability and derivatives, net 

Change in fair value of warrant liability and derivatives, net represents the revaluations each quarter of the warrant liabilities and derivatives. 

40 

Gain on sale of subsidiary 

Gain on the sale of the Mimosa business represents the proceeds less the costs and net assets and liabilities to calculate the gain on the sale. 

Income Tax Benefit 

Our provision for income tax benefit includes the expected benefit of all deferred tax assets, including our net operating loss carryforwards and expected tax credits under the UK s Research and Development Expenditure Credit RDEC regime. Our net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2024 and continue to expire through 2037. Our tax benefit has been impacted by non-deductible expenses, including equity compensation and research and development amortization. 

Net Loss 

Net loss is determined by subtracting operating and non-operating expenses from revenues. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income before
depreciation and amortization, interest expense and income taxes, and also adjusted to add back share-based compensation costs, changes
in the fair value of the warrant liability and embedded derivatives, loss on extinguishment of debt and gain on sale of subsidiary, as
these costs are not considered a part of our core business operations and are not an indicator of ongoing, future company performance.
We use Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our performance, both internally and as compared to our peers, because these measures exclude certain
items that may not be indicative of our core operating results, as well as items that can vary widely among companies within our industry.
For example, share-based compensation costs can be subject to volatility from changes in the market price per share of our Common Stock
or variations in the value and number of shares granted. 

Adjusted EBITDA is one of the primary metrics used by management to evaluate the financial performance of our business because it excludes, among other things, the effects of certain transactions that are outside the control of management, while other measures can differ significantly depending on long-term strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the jurisdictions in which we operate and capital investments. 

We present this non-GAAP financial measure because we believe it is frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry. Further, we believe it is helpful in highlighting trends in our operating results by focusing on our core operating results and is useful to evaluate our performance in conjunction with our GAAP financial measures. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered as an alternative to operating income, net income or earnings per share, as a measure of operating performance, cash flows or as a measure of liquidity. Non-GAAP financial measures are not necessarily calculated the same way by different companies and should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP measures. 

In particular, Adjusted EBITDA is subject to certain limitations, including the following: 

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect interest expense, or the amounts necessary to service interest or principal payments under the Fortress Credit Agreement; 

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect income tax provision (benefit), and because the payment of taxes is part of our operations, tax provision is a necessary element of our costs and ability to operate; 

Although depreciation and amortization are eliminated in the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any costs of such replacements; 

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the noncash component of share-based compensation; 

41 

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters we consider not to be reflective, on a recurring basis, of our ongoing operations; and 

Other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA or similarly titled measures differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. 

We adjust for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using Adjusted EBITDA only as supplemental information. 

Segments 

Our business is organized around one reportable segment, the development and supply of broadband wireless products and technologies. This is based on the objectives of the business and how our chief operating decision maker, the Chief Executive Officer, monitors operating performance and allocates resources.

Revenue from products and software licenses of
 64.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 decreased by 84.8 million, or 57.0 , from 148.9 million for the year ended
December 31, 2022. This decrease was primarily due to lower demand of products to two customers in Asia Pacific of 21.2 million,
lower demand to three customers in North America of 44.4 million (due to the sale of our subsidiary in August 2023), lower demand to
one customer in Europe of 2.4 million, lower demand to two customers in Latin America of 3.3 million, lower demand to one customer
in Middle East Africa of 2.5 million, and lower demand to all other customers of 11.0 million. 

Revenue from maintenance, warranty and services of 13.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 decreased by 4.8 million, or 26.5 , from 18.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This decrease was primarily due to decreases in service, NRE, and maintenance revenue of 1.5 million, 2.3 million, and 1.0 million respectively.

of 53.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 decreased by 41.9 million, or 44.0 , from 95.3 million for the year ended
December 31, 2022. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in products and software licenses revenue for the year ended December 31,
2023 due to the sale of our subsidiary in August 2023, offset by an inventory provision of 12.0 million for the year ended December 31,
2023. 

Cost of revenue from maintenance, warranty and services of 4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 decreased by 0.8 million, or 14.1 , from 5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, which is attributable to a decrease in maintenance and warranty.

Research and development Research
and development expenses were 45.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, a decrease of 16.4 million, or 36 , from 61.4
million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in headcount-related expenses of 13.2
million, share-based compensation of 2.2 million, and materials supplies expenses of 1.5 million. These decreases were offset
by an increase in other expenses of 0.5 million. 

Sales and marketing Sales and
marketing expenses were 18.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, a decrease of 12.3 million, or 67 from 30.6 million
for the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to a decrease in headcount-related expenses of 8.7 million and share-based
compensation of 1.8 million and other combined expenses of 1.6 million. 

General and administrative General and administrative expenses of 21.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 decreased by 18.4 million, or 85 , from 40.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily due to decreases in share-based compensation of 10.0 million, other outside service expenses of 3.6 million, headcount-related expenses of 2.6 million, facilities expenses of 1.4 million, and other expenses of 0.8 million. 

Amortization of intangibles Amortization
of intangibles of 0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 decreased by 0.9 million, or 450 , from 1.1 million for the
year ended December 31, 2022, due to the sale of Mimosa and the resulting elimination of the related intangible assets. 

Restructuring costs Restructuring costs of 5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased by 4.0 million, or 308 , from 1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, due to the 2023 Restructuring Program. 

Non-Operating Expenses 

Interest expense, net Interest expense, net was 39.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of 18.6 million from 20.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due to a higher average debt outstanding in 2023 compared to 2022, as well as higher variable interest rates and 10.7 million of debt waiver and amendment fees under the Fortress Credit Agreement and Convertible Notes. 

Change in fair value of warrant liability
and derivatives Change in fair value of warrant liability and derivatives was a gain of 2.1 million for the year ended December 31,
2023, a change of 5.0 million from a gain of 7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The fluctuation included changes
in fair values of derivative liability and warrants of 2.1 million and 7.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022,
respectively. The decrease is primarily a result of the Company s decreased stock price during the year ended December 31, 2023. 

44 

Loss on extinguishment of debt Loss on extinguishment of debt was 8.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared with no loss for the year ended December 31, 2022. There was a 5.1 million loss on the extinguishment of the senior term loan and 3.2 million loss on the extinguishment of the convertible debt. 

Other income (expense), net Other expense, net was income of 28.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, a change of 32.8 million from an expense of 4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The difference was primarily due to a gain on the sale of Mimosa of 28.4 million, foreign currency losses of 4.0 million, and other expenses of 0.4 million. 

Income tax benefit Income tax benefit was 0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, a minimal change from an income tax benefit of 0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. 

Net Loss 

We had net loss of 78.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, a change of 6.5 million compared to net loss of 85.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, due to the same factors described above. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

Adjusted EBITDA 

Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2023 was a loss of 55.3 million, representing a change of 10.1 million, or 22.2 , from a loss 45.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to the increase in net loss discussed above and certain higher adjusting items detailed in the table below.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

To date, our principal sources of liquidity have been our cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations, proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, preferred and common stock, and the sale of certain receivables. Our capital requirements depend on a number of factors, including sales, the extent of our spending on research and development, expansion of sales and marketing activities and market adoption of our products and services. The Company filed the Chapter 11 Cases on March 31, 2024. The Bankruptcy Court confirmed the Company s Prepackaged Plan on June 28, 2024. 

45 

We had 37.1 million of current assets and 194.3
million of current liabilities at December 31, 2023. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we used 39.7 million in cash
flows from operating activities, an increase of 7.5 million from December 31, 2022. We are investing heavily in 5G research and development
and expect to use cash from operations during the remainder of 2024 to fund research and development activities. Cash on hand and the
available borrowing capacity under the Fortress Credit Agreement may not allow us to meet our forecasted cash requirements. 

Days sales outstanding DSO is
a measurement of the time it takes to collect receivables. DSO is calculated by dividing accounts receivable, net as of the end of the
quarter by the average daily revenue for the quarter. Average daily revenue for the quarter is calculated by dividing the quarterly revenue
by ninety days. All customer accounts are actively managed, and no losses in excess of amounts reserved are currently expected. DSO can
fluctuate due to the timing and nature of contracts, as well as the payment terms of individual customers. DSO was 52 days and 101 days
as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease in DSO as of December 31, 2023 is attributable to a lower accounts
receivable balance due to the sale of Mimosa (see Note 3). Notwithstanding the DSO of 52 and 101 days as of December 31, 2023 and
2022, respectively, our accounts receivable were 10.4 million and 46.6 million due to high sales volumes in the fourth quarters of each
respective year. 

As of December 31, 2023, we had commitments with our main subcontract manufacturers under various purchase orders and forecast arrangements of 13.2 million, the majority of which have expected delivery dates during the first six months of 2024. 

As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe our existing cash resources are not sufficient to fund the cash needs of our business for at least the next 12 months. The Company filed the Chapter 11 Cases on March 31, 2024. The Bankruptcy Court confirmed the Company s Prepackaged Plan on June 28, 2024.

Operating Activities 

Net cash used in operating activities was 39.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, a decrease of 7.5 million from net cash used in operating activities of 47.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease is a result of 18.8 million less used from working capital, 12.7 million less from results of our operations and offset by a 24.0 million decrease in non-cash adjustments. 

Investing Activities 

Net cash provided by investing activities was
 53.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of 56.8 million from a use of cash of 3.1 million for the year
ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to the net proceeds from the sale of the Mimosa business of 55.0 million. 

46 

Financing Activities 

Net cash used in financing activities was 13.8
million for the year ended December 31, 2023. This included 24.9 million of repayments under the senior term loan, 16.8 million
of repayments under the convertible debt, 1.9 million of debt issuance costs, 0.2 million of payment for taxes withheld on stock awards,
partially offset by 30.0 million of borrowings under the senior term loan. 

Net cash used in financing activities was 5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This included 5.3 million of repayments under the senior term loan and 0.3 million of payment for taxes withheld on stock awards. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared
in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis, we evaluate the effectiveness of our estimates
and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition and share-based compensation. 

We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and may change as future events occur. 

We believe the following critical accounting policies are dependent on significant estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. 

Revenue recognition 

A contract s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. Certain of our contracts have multiple distinct performance obligations, as the promise to transfer individual goods or services is separately identifiable from other promises in the contracts and the customer can benefit from these individual goods or services either on their own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the contract s transaction price to each performance obligation based on its relative stand-alone selling price. The stand-alone selling prices are determined based on the prices at which we separately sell these products. For items that are not sold separately, we estimate the stand-alone selling prices using either an expected cost-plus margin or the adjusted market assessment approach depending on the nature of the specific performance obligation. 

Revenue from non-recurring engineering is recognized at a point in time or over-time depending on if the customer controls the asset being created or enhanced. For new product design or software development services, the customer does not control the asset being created, the customer is not simultaneously receiving or consuming the benefits from the work performed and the work performed has alternative use to the Company. Therefore, revenue related to these projects is recognized at a point in time which is when the specified developed technology has been delivered and accepted by the customer. 

Revenue from professional service contracts primarily relates to training and other consulting arrangements performed by the Company for its customers. Revenues from professional services contracts provided on a time and materials basis are recognized when the Company has the right to invoice under the practical expedient as amounts correspond directly with the value of the services rendered to date. 

47 

Share-based compensation 

We apply ASC 718, Share-based Payments. ASC 718 requires awards classified as equity awards to be accounted for using the estimated grant date fair value. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as an expense in the consolidated statements of operations over the requisite service periods. Share-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations includes compensation expense for share-based awards granted based on the estimated grant date fair value. Because share-based compensation expense is based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest, share-based compensation expense has been reduced to account for estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. 

We determine the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which is impacted by the following assumptions: 

Fair Value of Common Stock - To determine the grant date fair value of our Common Stock, we use the closing market price of our Common Stock at the grant date. 

Expected Term - Expected term is estimated based on our prior five years of historical data regarding expired, forfeited or if applicable, exercise behavior. 

Expected Volatility - Since we have limited historical basis for determining our own volatility, the expected volatility assumption was based on the average historical volatility of a representative peer group, which includes consideration of the peer company s industry, market capitalization, state of life cycle and capital structure. 

Expected Dividend Yield - The dividend yield assumption is based on our history and our expectation of no dividend payouts. 

Risk-Free Interest Rate - The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates appropriate for an equivalent remaining term equal to the expected life of the award. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

Refer to Note 2 of our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on accounting pronouncements. 

JOBS Act 

The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, relax certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. We qualify as an emerging growth company and under the JOBS Act are allowed to comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements based on the effective date for private (not publicly traded) companies. We are electing to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards, and as a result, we may not comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. As a result, the financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates. 

Additionally, we have chosen to rely on certain reduced reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, including, among other things, we are not required to (i) provide an auditor s attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404, (ii) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, (iii) comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis) and (iv) disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the Chief Executive Officer s compensation to median employee compensation. These exemptions will apply for a period of five years following the completion of New Beginnings initial public offering or until we are no longer an emerging growth company, whichever is earlier. 

48 

We will remain an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act until the earliest of: (i) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the closing of New Beginnings initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least 1.235 billion, or (c) when we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common equity held by non-affiliates exceeds 700.0 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter; or (ii) the date on which we have issued more than 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. 

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 

We are a smaller reporting company as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information under this item.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

Board of Directors and Stockholders 

 Airspan Networks Holdings Inc. 

Opinion on the financial statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Airspan Networks Holdings Inc. a Delaware corporation and subsidiaries (the
 Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders 
deficit, and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred
to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of
the two years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. 

Going
Concern 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed
in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company was in default of certain debt covenants of its senior term loan agreement and convertible
note agreement as of December 31, 2023. As a result, the Company s current liabilities exceed the Company s current assets
by approximately 157.1 million as of December 31, 2023. These conditions, along with other matters as set forth in Note 1, raise substantial
doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are also
described in Note 1. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this
uncertainty. 

Basis
for opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error
or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

AIRSPAN NETWORKS HOLDINGS INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

The Company had million of current assets and million of current liabilities at December 31, 2023. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company used million in cash flow from operating activities. The Company is investing heavily in 5G research and development, and the Company expects to continue to use cash from operations through the first quarter ended March 31, 2025. Cash on hand and borrowing capacity under our Assignment Agreement, Resignation and Assignment Agreement and Credit Agreement (the Fortress Credit Agreement with DBFIP ANI LLC Fortress (see Notes 14 and 15) may not allow the Company to reasonably expect to meet its forecasted cash requirements. 

Going concern 

The accompanying financial statements have been
prepared and are presented assuming the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. On March 31, 2024, the Company and certain of its affiliates and subsidiaries (collectively the Debtors filed
bankruptcy petitions under chapter 11 of title 11 of the United States Code, 11 U.S.C. 101-1532 in the Bankruptcy Court.
The Bankruptcy Court confirmed the Company s Prepackaged Plan on June 28, 2024. 

In addition, as discussed in Notes 14 and 15
to the consolidated financial statements, the Company s senior term loan and Convertible Notes require certain financial covenants
to be met. We were not in compliance with the minimum liquidity covenant under the Fortress Credit Agreement and the Fortress Convertible
Note Agreement at all times from October 26, 2023, which was an event of default under those agreements for which a waiver was obtained.
We also did not satisfy the revenue covenant and the EBITDA covenant on September 30, 2023, which were also events of default for
which a waiver was obtained. We also did not make cash payments of principal and interest under the Fortress Credit Agreement and the
Fortress Convertible Note on September 30, October 31, November 30, and December 31 within any grace period applicable
thereto, for which we obtained a deferral of such payments. We also obtained a prospective waiver of compliance with the minimum liquidity
covenant, the minimum last twelve-month EBITDA covenant and the minimum last twelve-month revenue covenant under the Fortress Credit
Agreement and the Fortress Convertible Note Agreement as of the December 31, 2023 quarterly measurement date. 

In order to address the need to satisfy the Company s continuing obligations and realize its long-term strategy, management has taken several steps and is considering additional actions to improve its operating and financial results, including the following: 

focusing the Company s efforts to increase sales in additional geographic markets; 

continuing to develop 5G product offerings that will expand the market for the Company s products; 

continuing to improve days sales outstanding to provide additional liquidity: and 

continuing to implement cost reduction initiatives to reduce non-strategic costs in operations and expand the Company s labor force in lower cost geographies, with headcount reductions in higher cost geographies. 

There can be no assurance that the above actions
will be successful. Without additional financing or capital, the Company s current cash balance would be insufficient to satisfy
repayment demands from its lenders if the lenders elect to declare the senior term loan and the senior secured convertible notes due prior
to the maturity date. There is no assurance that the new or renegotiated financing will be available, or that if available, will have
satisfactory terms. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one
year after the date that these financial statements are issued. If the Company emerges from bankruptcy under the currently proposed Restructuring
Support Agreement RSA ), this is expected to provide adequate equity financing and eliminate all existing senior and subordinated
debt. In addition, the Company expects to have access to a million revolving line of credit. The accompanying consolidated financial
statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts or the amount and
classification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

million subordinated Convertible Promissory Note (the Golden Wayford Note pursuant to a Subordinated Convertible Note Purchase Agreement. The Golden Wayford Note was amended and restated on November 28, 2017, to reduce the interest rate thereon and to reflect the application of the payment of million of principal on such note. The Golden Wayford Note had an original maturity date of , which through subsequent amendments was extended to June 30, 2020. The conversion rights related to this agreement expired on its maturity date, June 30, 2020, and on this date the loan was reclassified from Subordinated Convertible Debt to Subordinated Debt. 

The principal and accrued interest under the Golden Wayford Note would have been automatically converted into common shares at the time of the next equity financing and consummated prior to, on or after the maturity date (June 30, 2020). Such conversion right expired in accordance with its term. Interest accrues at per annum and is payable quarterly, however, because such payment is prohibited by the terms of the subordination, interest is (in accordance with the terms of the related promissory note) paid in kind. 

The Golden Wayford Note is subordinate to the obligations under the Fortress Credit Agreement (see Note 14). A limited waiver under the Fortress Credit Agreement waives each actual and prospective default and event of default existing under the Fortress Credit Agreement directly as a result of the non-payment of the Golden Wayford Note. 

The Company had subordinated debt outstanding of million, plus million and million of accrued interest as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The subordinated debt is classified as a current liability.

On July 3, 2017, Legacy Airspan entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Subordinated Term Loan Agreement that extended the maturity date to June 30, 2019. On May 23, 2019, Legacy Airspan entered into Amendment No. 3 to the Subordinated Term Loan Agreement that extended the maturity date to December 31, 2020. On March 30, 2020, Legacy Airspan entered into Amendment No. 4 to the Subordinated Term Loan Agreement that extended the maturity date to . On December 30, 2020, Legacy Airspan entered into Amendment No. 5 to the Subordinated Term Loan Agreement that extended the maturity date to the later of (a) December 30, 2024 and (b) 365 days after the maturity date of the Fortress Credit Agreement (as in effect on December 30, 2020) (see Note 14). The term loan is subordinate to the Fortress Credit Agreement (see Note 14). 

Prior to May 23, 2019, interest accrued at 2.475 per annum and was payable quarterly. In accordance with the amendments below, the interest rate changed as follows: 

(a) 
 Amendment No. 3, on May 23, 2019, the interest rate changed to 9.0 per annum to be accrued; 

(b)

The principal and accrued interest may be repaid early without penalty.

 warrants to purchase shares of the Company s common stock. On August 11, 2023, the Company, Legacy Airspan and certain of our subsidiaries who are party to the Fortress Credit Agreement entered into the August 2023 Fortress Credit Amendment to, among other things, implement certain modifications to the Fortress Credit Agreement relating to the Purchase Agreement and the Transaction. On November 14, 2023, the Company, Legacy Airspan and certain of our subsidiaries who are party to the Fortress Credit Agreement entered into the November Fortress Credit Amendment to, among other things, amend and restate the Fortress Credit Agreement, effect a limited waiver of certain events of default under the Fortress Credit Agreement, establish new delayed draw term loan commitments in the amount of 5.0 million, and establish certain new covenants. On December 22, 2023, the Company, Legacy Airspan and certain of our subsidiaries who are party to the Fortress Credit Agreement entered into the December 2023 Fortress Credit Agreement to, among other things, amend and restate the Fortress Credit Agreement, effect a limited waiver of certain existing and potential prospective events of default under the Fortress Credit Agreement, establish new delayed draw term loan commitments in the amount of 10.0 million, defer the due date of certain cash payments of principal and interest under the Fortress Credit Agreement, and establish certain new covenants. 

With the May 2023 Credit Agreement Amendment,
the interest rates were increased to plus SOFR to up to for the paid in-kind interest. The maturity of the loan did not change.
The Company accounted for the May 2023 Credit Agreement Amendment as a loss on debt extinguishment of which million is related
to the senior term loan. 

The Fortress Credit Agreement initial term loan total
commitment of 
 million and a term loan commitment of 
 million were both funded to Legacy Airspan on December 30, 2020. After giving effect to the May 2023 Fortress Credit
Amendment, the November 2023 Fortress Credit Amendment, the December 2023 Fortress Credit Amendment, we expanded the term loan
commitment, subject to the terms of the Fortress Credit Agreement. The maturity date of the total loan commitment is . 

To secure its obligations under the Fortress Credit Agreement, Fortress was assigned PWB s security interest under the PWB Facility and the Company granted Fortress as security for the obligations a security interest in (a) all of the real, personal and mixed property in which liens are granted or purported to be granted pursuant to any of the collateral documents as security for the obligations, (b) all products, proceeds, rents and profits of such property, (c) all of each loan party s book and records (d) all of the foregoing whether now owned or existing, in each case excluding certain excluded assets. 

The Fortress Credit Agreement contains representations and warranties, events of default and affirmative and negative covenants, which include, among other things, certain restrictions on the ability to pay dividends, create liens, incur additional indebtedness, make investments, dispose of assets, consummate business combinations (except for permitted investments, as defined in the Fortress Credit Agreement), and make distributions. In addition, financial covenants apply. Prior to the March 2022 Fortress Credit Amendment, these financial covenants included (a) minimum liquidity of 4.0 million as of December 31, 2020 and 5.0 million thereafter, (b) minimum last twelve-month revenue and (c) minimum last twelve-month Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization EBITDA ). Pursuant to the March 2022 Fortress Credit Amendment, the financial covenants included in the Fortress Credit Agreement were amended to increase the minimum liquidity requirement to an amount between million and million, depending on EBITDA performance levels and whether a default or event of default exists under the Fortress Credit Agreement, and decrease the minimum last twelve-month revenue and EBITDA requirements. Revenue and EBITDA financial covenants are tested quarterly. Pursuant to the May 2023 Fortress Credit Amendment, the financial covenants included in the Fortress Credit Agreement were amended to reduce the minimum liquidity requirement to a minimum of, prior to the closing of the Transaction, million, and after the closing of the Transaction, million. 

The Company was not in compliance with the minimum liquidity covenant under the Fortress Credit Agreement and the Fortress Convertible Note Agreement at all times from October 26, 2023, which was an event of default under those agreements for which the Company obtained a waiver. The Company also did not satisfy the revenue covenant and the EBITDA covenant on September 30, 2023, which were also events of default for which the Company obtained a waiver. The Company also did not make cash payments of principal and interest under the Fortress Credit Agreement and the Fortress Convertible Note on September 30, October 31, November 30, and December 31 within any grace period applicable thereto, for which we obtained a deferral of such payments. The Company also obtained a prospective waiver of compliance with the minimum liquidity covenant, the minimum last twelve-month EBITDA covenant and the minimum last twelve-month revenue covenant under the Fortress Credit Agreement and the Fortress Convertible Note Agreement as of the December 31, 2023 quarterly measurement date. 

There can be no assurance that the lenders under the Fortress Credit Agreement and the agreement governing the Company s senior secured convertible notes will agree to waive future covenant breaches. Based on management s current forecast, absent of additional financing or capital raising, the Company has concluded it is probable that the Company will not be in compliance with certain of the prospective financial covenants under the Fortress Credit Agreement and the agreement governing the Company s senior secured convertible notes during certain periods over the next twelve months. Accordingly, while the Company may seek future waivers from compliance with the applicable covenants in connection with such anticipated breaches, or amendments of existing financial covenants included in the Fortress Credit Agreement and the agreement governing the Company s senior secured convertible notes, the Company is also pursuing alternative sources of capital so that it would be able to satisfy its prospective minimum liquidity obligations under the Fortress Credit Agreement and the agreement governing the Company s senior secured convertible notes. There can be no assurance that the lenders under the Fortress Credit Agreement and the agreement governing the Company s senior secured convertible notes will agree to waive any breaches thereunder that may arise in the future or that we will otherwise be able to remedy such breaches. 

In the absence of waivers or remedies of existing covenant breaches or any additional breaches that may arise in the future, the lenders under the Fortress Credit Agreement and the agreement governing the Company s senior secured convertible notes could (i) elect to declare all the funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest and other premiums, and institute foreclosure proceedings against the Company s assets, (ii) elect to apply the default interest rate under the Fortress Credit Agreement and the Fortress Convertible Note Agreement and related agreements, and (iii) with respect to the Fortress Credit Agreement, elect to terminate their delayed draw commitments thereunder and cease making further loans. As a result of any of these actions, the Company could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. In addition, the Company s subordinated term loan related party (see Note 13) and subordinated debt (see Note 12) could be accelerated or required to be paid due to provisions contained within those instruments. As a result, the Company has classified its senior term loan, convertible debt, subordinated term loan and subordinated debt as current at December 31, 2023. 

In connection with the Fortress Credit Agreement, the Company granted Fortress entities party to the Fortress Credit Agreement a warrant to purchase shares of Legacy Airspan s Series H Senior Convertible Preferred Stock at a purchase price of . See Note 19 for additional information about the Series H Senior Convertible Preferred Stock. These warrants were recorded at fair value and recorded as a discount to the debt and will be amortized over the term of the debt instrument. In connection with the May 2023 Fortress Credit Amendment, the Company granted certain Fortress entities party to the May 2023 Fortress Credit Amendment a warrant to purchase shares of common stock of the Company at a purchase price of 0.01 per share subject to the terms and conditions of the related warrant agreement (the May 2023 Warrants ). See Note 19 for additional information about the May 2023 Warrants. 

The interest rate for Tranche 1 is based on the level of the Company s Net EBITDA Leverage Ratio, as defined in the Fortress Credit Agreement. The initial applicable rate for Tranche 1 is set at Level V (see table below).

The Convertible Notes will mature on , unless earlier accelerated, converted, redeemed or repurchased. Under certain circumstances, a default interest will apply following an event of default under the Convertible Notes at a per annum rate equal to the lower of (i) the Base Rate plus 3.75 and (ii) the maximum amount permitted by law. The Convertible Notes are pari passu in right of payment and lien priority and are secured by a security interest in (a) all of the real, personal and mixed property in which liens are granted or purported to be granted pursuant to any of the collateral documents as security for the obligations, (b) all products, proceeds, rents and profits of such property, (c) all of each loan party s book and records and (d) all of the foregoing whether now owned or existing, in each case excluding certain excluded assets.

On November 14, 2023, the Company, Legacy Airspan and certain of our subsidiaries who are party to the Fortress Convertible Note Purchase and Guarantee Agreement entered into a Limited Waiver and Consent, Fourth Amendment to Senior Secured Convertible Note Purchase and Guarantee Agreement and Reaffirmation of Note Documents relating to the Fortress Convertible Note Agreement with Fortress (the November 2023 Fortress Convertible Note Agreement Amendment to, among other things, effect a limited waiver of certain events of default under the Fortress Convertible Note Agreement, and establish certain new covenants. On December 22, 2023, the Company, and certain of its subsidiaries who are party to the Fortress Convertible Note Agreement entered into a Limited Waiver and Consent, Fifth Amendment to Senior Secured Convertible Note Purchase and Guarantee Agreement and Reaffirmation of Note Documents relating to the Fortress Convertible Note Agreement with Fortress (the December 2023 Fortress Convertible Note Agreement Amendment to, among other things, effect a limited waiver of certain existing and potential prospective events of default under the Fortress Convertible Note Agreement, establish certain new covenants, and defer the due date of certain cash payments of interest under the Fortress Convertible Notes. 

Prior to the March 2022 Fortress Convertible Note Agreement Amendment, the Convertible Notes, together with all accrued but unpaid interest thereon, were convertible, in whole or in part, at any time prior to the payment in full of the principal amount thereof (together with all accrued but unpaid interest thereon), into shares of Common Stock at a conversion price equal to 12.50 per share. Pursuant to the March 2022 Fortress Convertible Note Agreement Amendment, the conversion price with respect to the Convertible Notes was decreased to 8.00 per share. The conversion price with respect to the Convertible Notes is subject to adjustment to reflect stock splits and subdivisions, stock and other dividends and distributions, recapitalizations, reclassifications, combinations and other similar changes in capital structure. The conversion price with respect to the Convertible Notes is also subject to a broad-based weighted average anti-dilution adjustment in the event the Company issues, or is deemed to have issued, shares of Common Stock, other than certain excepted issuances, at a price below the conversion price then in effect. In addition, pursuant to the March 2022 Fortress Convertible Note Agreement Amendment, if, during the period commencing on and including the date of the March 2022 Fortress Convertible Note Agreement Amendment and ending on and including the 15-month anniversary of the date of the March 2022 Fortress Convertible Note Agreement Amendment, there is no 30 consecutive trading day-period during which the average of the daily volume weighted average price of the Common Stock Daily VWAP for such 30 consecutive trading day-period (after excluding the three highest and the three lowest Daily VWAPs during such period) equals or exceeds 10.00 (as adjusted for stock splits, stock combinations, dividends, distributions, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like), the conversion price with respect to the Convertible Notes will be reduced to the amount that such conversion price would otherwise have been had the conversion price with respect to the Convertible Notes been 6.00 on the date of the March 2022 Fortress Convertible Note Agreement Amendment.

The Company was not in compliance with the minimum liquidity covenant under the Fortress Credit Agreement and the Fortress Convertible Note Agreement at all times from October 26, 2023, which was an event of default under those agreements for which the Company obtained a waiver. The Company also did not satisfy the revenue covenant and the EBITDA covenant on September 30, 2023, which were also events of default for which the Company obtained a waiver. The Company also did not make cash payments of principal and interest under the Fortress Credit Agreement and the Fortress Convertible Note on September 30, October 31, November 30, and December 31 within any grace period applicable thereto, for which we obtained a deferral of such payments. The Company also obtained a prospective waiver of compliance with the minimum liquidity covenant, the minimum last twelve-month EBITDA covenant and the minimum last twelve-month revenue covenant under the Fortress Credit Agreement and the Fortress Convertible Note Agreement as of the December 31, 2023 quarterly measurement date. 

There can be no assurance that the lenders under the Fortress Credit Agreement and the agreement governing the Company s senior secured convertible notes will agree to waive future covenant breaches. Based on management s current forecast, absent of additional financing or capital raising, the Company has concluded it is probable that the Company will not be in compliance with certain of the prospective financial covenants under the Fortress Credit Agreement and the agreement governing the Company s senior secured convertible notes during certain periods of the next twelve months. Accordingly, while the Company may seek future waivers from compliance with the applicable covenants in connection with such anticipated breaches, or amendments of existing financial covenants included in the Fortress Credit Agreement and the agreement governing the Company s senior secured convertible notes, the Company is also pursuing alternative sources of capital so that it would be able to satisfy its prospective minimum liquidity obligations under the Fortress Credit Agreement and the agreement governing the Company s senior secured convertible notes. There can be no assurance that the lenders under the Fortress Credit Agreement and the agreement governing the Company s senior secured convertible notes will agree to waive any breaches thereunder that may arise in the future or that we will otherwise be able to remedy such breaches. 

In the absence of waivers or remedies of existing covenant breaches or any additional breaches that may arise in the future, the lenders under the Fortress Credit Agreement and the agreement governing the Company s senior secured convertible notes could (i) elect to declare all the funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest and other premiums, and institute foreclosure proceedings against the Company s assets, (ii) elect to apply the default interest rate under the Fortress Credit Agreement and the Fortress Convertible Note Agreement and related agreements, and (iii) with respect to the Fortress Credit Agreement, elect to terminate their delayed draw commitments thereunder and cease making further loans. As a result of any of these actions, the Company could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. In addition, the Company s subordinated term loan related party (see Note 13) and subordinated debt (see Note 12) could be accelerated or required to be paid due to provisions contained within those instruments. The Company has classified its senior term loan, convertible debt, subordinated term loan and subordinated debt as current at December 31, 2023.

The conversion option derivative and call and contingent put derivative are considered a Level 3 measurement due to the utilization of significant unobservable inputs in the valuation. The Company utilized a binomial model to estimate the fair value of the embedded derivative features requiring bifurcation associated with the Convertible Notes payable at issuance date and as of the December 31, 2023 reporting date. The key inputs to the valuation models that were utilized to estimate the fair value of the convertible debt derivative liabilities include:

The Company s operating leases consist of various office facilities. The Company uses a portfolio approach to account for such leases due to the similarities in characteristics and apply an incremental borrowing rate equal to the average interest rate of the Company s existing debt facilities. The Company s office leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company accounts for lease components (e.g. fixed payments including rent, real estate taxes and common area maintenance costs) as a single lease component. Some of our leases include one or more options to renew the lease term at our sole discretion. The Company has included in the calculation of the Company s lease liability or right-of-use lease assets options to renew that are reasonably certain of exercise.

The Company had bank guarantees with its landlords and customers totalling million as of both December 31, 2023 and 2022. The guarantees secure payment or performance obligations of the Company under contracts. At December 31, 2023, the Company had pledged cash to the banks as collateral for guarantees aggregating million, which is substantially all recorded as other non-current assets. 

In addition to the guarantees mentioned above, the Company has issued a guarantee to Tekes, the main public funding organization for research and development in Finland (See Note 16), for the repayment of loans taken out by its fully consolidated subsidiary, Airspan Finland Oy. These uncollateralized loans totalled million at December 31, 2023, which includes million of accrued interest. 

Contingencies and Legal Proceedings 

From time to time, the Company receives and reviews correspondence from third parties with respect to licensing their patents and other intellectual property in connection with the sale of the Company s products. Disputes may arise with such third parties if an agreement cannot be reached regarding the licensing of such patents or intellectual property. 

On October 14, 2019, Barkan Wireless IP Holdings, L.P. Barkan filed a suit against Sprint Corporation and related entities Sprint in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging patent infringement based in part on two of the Company s products, Airave 4 and Magic Box Gold. See Barkan Wireless IP Holdings, L.P. v. Sprint Corporation et al , Case No. 2:19-cv-00336-JRG (E.D. Tex.). On March 26, 2021, after a settlement between Barkan and Sprint, the court granted an agreed motion to dismiss and the case was closed. Sprint had demanded that the Company indemnify Sprint 3,870,000 for a portion of the amounts Sprint paid to defend and settle the case. On April 27, 2021, Sprint gave notice that it intends to set-off amounts it owes the Company until Sprint s indemnity demand is satisfied. The Company disputes Sprint s indemnity demand and, on March 15, 2022, filed a complaint for breach of contract in the United States District Court for the District of Kansas. See Airspan Networks, Inc. v. Sprint/United Management Company , Case No. 2:22-cv-02104-JAR-ADM (D. Kan.). That complaint was subsequently voluntarily dismissed by the Company and the underlying breach of contract claim is now a counterclaim in the matter captioned Sprint Communications Company, L.P et al. vs. Casa Systems, Inc. et al., No. 22CV02327 Div.7 pending in the District Court of Johnson County Kansas. On January 3, 2023, the parties settled this matter. The Company had previously provided for a reserve for an estimated amount of exposure related to this matter in a prior year. The settlement resulted in an additional 0.6 million legal settlement which was recognized in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ending December 31, 2022. 

Except as set forth above, the Company is not currently subject to any other material legal proceedings. The Company may from time to time become a party to various other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of its business. While the results of such claims and litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company currently believes that it is not a party to any litigation the final outcome of which is likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Common Stock Warrants 

As of December 31, 2023, there are Common Stock Warrants outstanding, consisting of and Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants, respectively. 

As part of NBA s initial public offering, Public Warrants were sold. The Public Warrants entitle the holder thereof to purchase one share of Common Stock at a price of per share, subject to adjustment. The Public Warrants may be exercised only for a whole number of shares of Common Stock. No fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the Public Warrants. The Public Warrants will expire on August 13, 2026 at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. 

The Company may redeem the Public Warrants when exercisable, in whole and not in part, at a price of 0.01 per warrant, so long as the Company provides not less than 30 days prior written notice of redemption to each warrant holder, and if, and only if, the reported last sale price of the Common Stock equals or exceeds 18.00 per share for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders. 

Simultaneously with the Company s initial public offering, NBA consummated a private placement of Private Placement Warrants with its sponsor. The Private Placement Warrants are exercisable for one share of Common Stock at a price of 11.50 per share, subject to adjustment. The Private Placement Warrants are identical to the Public Warrants, except that, so long as the Private Placement Warrants are held by the initial purchaser or its permitted transferees, the Private Placement Warrants: (1) may be exercised for cash or on a cashless basis; (2) may not be transferred, assigned or sold until thirty (30) days after the date of the Closing; and (3) may not be redeemed.

Share-based compensation is recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. Employee stock options stock options granted under the Plans generally vest ratably over a four-year period and expire on the tenth anniversary of their issuance. Restricted stock is Common Stock that is subject to a risk of forfeiture or other restrictions that will lapse upon satisfaction of specified performance conditions and/or the passage of time. Awards of restricted stock RSAs that vest only by the passage of time will generally vest one year following the Business Combination. RSUs represent the right to receive Common Stock upon satisfaction of the passage of time. Awards of RSUs that vest only by the passage of time will generally vest ratably over three years from the date of grant; however, the awards of RSUs granted to the MIP Participants in the Business Combination vest one year following the Closing of the Business Combination.

Common Stock Options 

The value of each stock option grant is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model BSM ). The option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, as detailed below: 

Grant date fair value : the Company uses the closing market price of its Common Stock at the grant date; 

Expected volatility : since the Company has limited historical basis for determining its own volatility, the expected volatility assumption was based on the average historical volatility of a representative peer group, which includes the consideration of the peer company s industry, market capitalization, state of life cycle, and capital structure; 

Risk-free interest rates : based upon observed interest rates appropriate for the term of the Company s stock options; 

Expected term : estimated based on the Company s prior five years of historical data regarding expired, forfeited or if applicable, exercise behavior; and 

Expected dividend yield : based on the Company s history and expectation of no dividend payouts. 

The Company used the following assumptions for the BSM to determine the fair value of the stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022: 

Risk-free interest rate

Expected term (in years)

Utilization of the U.S. net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and similar state provisions, due to ownership change limitations that have occurred previously or that could occur in the future. These ownership changes may limit the amount of net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income and tax, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had completed a 2023 Section 382 study to assess whether a change of ownership has occurred in connection with certain of its U.S. net operating losses and credit carryforwards. The Company has reduced its deferred taxes in the amount of million as a result of the sale of Mimosa. 

Since the Company s utilization of these deferred tax assets is dependent on future profits, a valuation allowance equal to the net deferred tax assets has been provided as it is considered more likely than not that such assets will not be realized. The valuation allowance includes a reduction in deferred tax assets through tax rate reductions in non-US jurisdictions. Through December 31, 2023, the Company has historically concluded that a full valuation allowance is required to offset the net deferred tax assets.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed pursuant to the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules, regulations and related forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and President, and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within an organization have been detected. Accordingly, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of our disclosure control system are met. 

As required by Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) under the Exchange Act, our Chief Executive Officer and President, and Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2023. Based on their evaluation, the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective and operating to provide reasonable assurance that material information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, including ensuring that such material information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and President, and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure as of December 31, 2023. 

Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by our Board, our management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with policies and procedures may deteriorate. 

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the 2013 Internal Control Integrated Framework (the COSO Framework ). Based on this evaluation under the COSO Framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023.

Corporate Governance 

We have structured our corporate governance in a manner we believe closely aligns our interests with those of our stockholders. Notable features of this corporate governance include:

at least one of our directors qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as defined by the SEC; and 

we have implemented a range of other corporate governance best practices, including a robust director education program. 

Composition of the Board of Directors 

Our business and affairs are managed under the direction of our Board. Our Board is staggered in three classes. As of December 31, 2023, due to resignations from the Board, we had no directors in Class I, two directors in Class II (Michael T. Flynn and Scot B. Jarvis), and three directors in Class III (Thomas S. Huseby, Glen Laxdal and Marc Heimowitz). On February 23, 2024, the Board reassigned Mr. Laxdal to Class I to restore balance among classes. Currently, Messrs. Flynn and Jarvis are independent under NYSE American listing standards and applicable SEC rules.

 The termination payment arrangements for the named executive officers were individually negotiated with each named executive officer at different time periods. We do not have a policy or set parameters for such arrangements and do not believe that such arrangements materially affected the other compensation elements for the named executive officers. 

Upon the occurrence of a change in control , as defined in our stock option agreements under our equity compensation plans, the following provisions apply to option awards under our equity compensation plans: 

Upon the occurrence of a change in control (as defined below), if we or any successor, assign, or purchaser thereof does not either: (a) continue the option (as adjusted, if necessary, to retain its pre- change in control economic value and aggregate spread between the option shares fair market value and exercise price) or (b) grant a new option of at least equivalent economic value, aggregate spread, and other terms and conditions as the pre- change in control option, then an additional 50 percent (100 percent in the case of options granted to Mr. Stonestrom and Mr. Brant) of any remaining unvested options will automatically vest. In the case of options granted to Mr. Stonestrom and Mr. Brant, if there is a change in control and we or any successor, assign, or purchaser thereof either: (i) continues the option (as adjusted, if necessary, to retain its pre- change in control economic value and aggregate spread between the option shares fair market value and exercise price) or (ii) grants a new option of at least equivalent economic value, aggregate spread, and other terms and conditions as the pre- change in control option, and within two years of the effective date of the change in control either optionee s employment is terminated, or the optionee voluntarily terminates their employment with good reason, then 100 percent of any remaining options will automatically vest. All such vested options may be exercised (together with any other previously or subsequently vested options) until the later of (A) the date related to termination of the employee, or (B) one year from such change in control , but in no event longer than ten years from the original date of grant. 

A change in control as defined in the stock option agreements under our equity compensation plans means any consolidation or merger of us with or into another corporation or entity (after which our pre-existing stockholders do not own a majority of the outstanding shares of the surviving entity), an acquisition or sale of substantially all of our assets or a sale of stock in a single transaction (or several related transactions) to one person (or a group acting together) who, as a result of such transaction, shall own more than 50 voting control of us, or any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our affairs.

Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters. 

The following table sets forth information known
to us regarding the beneficial ownership of our Common Stock as of September 30, 2024, by: 

each person who is the beneficial owner of more than 5 of issued and outstanding shares of our Common Stock; 

each of our current named executive officers and directors; and 

all of our executive officers and directors as a group. 

Beneficial ownership is determined according
to the rules of the SEC, which generally provide that a person has beneficial ownership of a security if he, she or it possesses sole
or shared voting or investment power over that security, which includes the power to dispose of or to direct the disposition of the security
or the right to acquire such powers within 60 days. In computing the number of shares of our Common Stock beneficially owned by a person
or entity and the percentage ownership, we deem outstanding shares of our Common Stock subject to options and Warrants held by that person
or entity that are currently exercisable or exercisable within 60 days of September 30, 2024. We do not deem these shares outstanding,
however, for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person or entity. 

Unless otherwise indicated, and subject to applicable community property laws, we believe that the persons and entities named in the table have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by them. 

The beneficial ownership of shares of our Common
Stock is based on 74,638,893 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding as of September 30, 2024.

Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence. 

Amended Credit Agreement 

At Closing, on August 13, 2021, the Company, Legacy Airspan and certain of its subsidiaries who are party to the Fortress Credit Agreement entered into the August 2021 Fortress Amendment with Fortress to, among other things, add the Company as a guarantor, recognize and account for the Business Combination, recognize and account for the Convertible Notes and provide updated procedures for replacement of LIBOR. On March 29, 2022, the Company, Legacy Airspan and certain of its subsidiaries who are party to the Fortress Credit Agreement entered into the March 2022 Fortress Credit Amendment to, among other things, amend the financial covenants included in the Fortress Credit Agreement. On November 14, 2022, the Company, Legacy Airspan and certain of our subsidiaries who are party to the Fortress Credit Agreement entered into the November 2022 Fortress Credit Amendment to, among other things, effect a limited waiver of certain events of default under the Fortress Credit Agreement. On May 18, 2023, the Company, Legacy Airspan and certain of our subsidiaries who are party to the Fortress Credit Agreement entered into the May 2023 Fortress Credit Amendment to, among other things. effect a limited waiver of certain events of default under the Fortress Credit Agreement. On August 11, 2023, the Company, Legacy Airspan and certain of our subsidiaries who are party to the Fortress Credit Agreement entered into the August 2023 Fortress Credit Amendment to, among other things, implement certain modifications to the Fortress Credit Agreement relating to the Purchase Agreement and the Transaction. On November 14, 2023, the Company, Legacy Airspan and certain of our subsidiaries who are party to the Fortress Credit Agreement entered into the November Fortress Credit Amendment to, among other things, effect a limited waiver of certain events of default under the Fortress Credit Agreement and establish new delayed draw term loan commitments under the November 2023 Fortress Credit Agreement. On December 22, 2023, the Company, Legacy Airspan and certain of our subsidiaries who are party to the Fortress Credit Agreement entered into the December 2023 Fortress Credit Agreement to, among other things, effect a limited waiver of certain events of default under the Fortress Credit Agreement, establish new delayed draw term loan commitments under the December 2023 Fortress Credit Agreement, and defer the due date of certain cash payments of principal and interest under the Fortress Credit Agreement. SoftBank has an indirect, non-controlling beneficial interest in Fortress, which is the agent and principal lender under the Fortress Credit Agreement. At December 31, 2023, there was approximately 59.5 million aggregate principal amount of indebtedness outstanding under the Fortress Credit Agreement, which is the largest aggregate principal amount outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2023. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we paid approximately 2.9 million in interest and 29.1 million of principal under the Fortress Credit Agreement. 

The Fortress Credit Agreement has a maturity date of December 30, 2024. Under the Fortress Credit Agreement, the initial term loan Tranche 1 total commitment of 34.0 million and a term loan PIK or Paid-in-Kind commitment of 10.0 million Tranche 2 were both funded to Legacy Airspan on December 30, 2020. Under the May 2023 Fortress Credit Agreement Amendment, the November 2023 Fortress Credit Agreement Amendment, the December 2023 Fortress Credit Agreement Amendment, and the terms of the Fortress Credit Agreement, we expanded the term loan commitment, subject to the terms of the Fortress Credit Agreement. The Fortress Credit Agreement contains a prepayment premium of 5.0 if the prepayment occurs during the period from December 30, 2021 through December 29, 2022, and 3.0 if the prepayment occurs during the period from December 30, 2022 through December 29, 2023. The Fortress Credit Agreement also contains a prohibition on prepayment during the period from December 30, 2020 through December 29, 2021 and a related fee in the amount of the make-whole amount of interest that would have been payable had such prepayment not been made. 

To secure its obligations under the Fortress Credit Agreement, Fortress was assigned PWB s security interest under the PWB Facility and we granted Fortress, as security for the obligations, a security interest in (a) all of the real, personal and mixed property in which liens are granted or purported to be granted pursuant to any of the collateral documents as security for the obligations, (b) all products, proceeds, rents and profits of such property, (c) all of each loan party s book and records and (d) all of the foregoing whether now owned or existing, in each case excluding certain excluded assets. 

65 

The Fortress Credit Agreement contains representations and warranties, events of default and affirmative and negative covenants, which include, among other things, certain restrictions on the ability to pay dividends, create liens, incur additional indebtedness, make investments, dispose of assets, consummate business combinations (except for permitted investments, as defined in the Fortress Credit Agreement), and make distributions. In addition, financial covenants apply. Prior to the March 2022 Fortress Credit Amendment, these financial covenants included (a) minimum liquidity of 4.0 million as of December 31, 2020 and 5.0 million thereafter, (b) minimum last twelve-month revenue and (c) minimum last twelve-month EBITDA. Pursuant to the March 2022 Fortress Credit Amendment, the financial covenants included in the Fortress Credit Agreement were amended to increase the minimum liquidity requirement to an amount between 15.0 million and 20.0 million, depending on EBITDA performance levels and whether a default or event of default exists under the Fortress Credit Agreement, and decrease the minimum last twelve-month revenue and EBITDA requirements. Revenue and EBITDA financial covenants are tested quarterly. Pursuant to the May 2023 Fortress Credit Amendment, the financial covenants included in the Fortress Credit Agreement were amended to reduce the minimum liquidity requirement to a minimum of, prior to the closing of the Transaction, 2.0 million, and after the closing of the Transaction, 4.0 million.

Prior to the March 2022 Fortress Convertible Note Agreement Amendment, each Convertible Note, together with all accrued but unpaid interest thereon, was convertible, in whole or in part, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time prior to the payment in full of the principal amount thereof (together with all accrued but unpaid interest thereon), into shares of our Common Stock at a conversion price equal to 12.50 per share. Pursuant to the March 2022 Fortress Convertible Note Agreement Amendment, the conversion price with respect to the Convertible Notes was decreased to 8.00 per share. The conversion price with respect to the Convertible Notes is subject to adjustment to reflect stock splits and subdivisions, stock and other dividends and distributions, recapitalizations, reclassifications, combinations and other similar changes in capital structure. The conversion price with respect to the Convertible Notes is subject to a broad-based weighted average anti-dilution adjustment in the event we issue, or are deemed to have issued, shares of our Common Stock, other than certain excepted issuances, at a price below the conversion price then in effect. In addition, pursuant to the March 2022 Fortress Convertible Note Agreement Amendment, if, during the period commencing on and including the date of the March 2022 Fortress Convertible Note Agreement Amendment and ending on and including the 15-month anniversary of the date of the March 2022 Fortress Convertible Note Agreement Amendment, there is no 30 consecutive trading day-period during which the average of the Daily VWAPs for such 30 consecutive trading day-period (after excluding the three highest and three lowest Daily VWAPs during such period) equals or exceeds 10.00 (as adjusted for stock splits, stock combinations, dividends, distributions, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like), the conversion price with respect to the Convertible Notes will be reduced to the amount that such conversion price would otherwise have been had the conversion price with respect to the Convertible Notes been 6.00 on the date of the March 2022 Fortress Convertible Note Agreement Amendment. Notwithstanding the above, the number of shares of our Common Stock that may be acquired by a holder upon any conversion of a Convertible Note will be limited to the extent necessary to insure that, following such conversion, the total number of shares of our Common Stock then beneficially owned by that holder and its affiliates and any other person whose beneficial ownership of our Common Stock would be aggregated with the holder s for purposes of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act does not exceed 4.999 of the total number of issued and outstanding shares of our Common Stock (including the shares of our Common Stock issuable upon such conversion). 

69 

Upon the occurrence of a change of control, or if our Common Stock or other securities into which the Convertible Notes are then convertible cease to be listed for trading on a U.S. national securities exchange, in each case, prior to the maturity date of the Convertible Notes, a holder of Convertible Notes will have the right, at its option, to require us to repurchase for cash all or a portion of the holder s Convertible Notes at a repurchase price equal to the sum of (i) all of the principal to be repurchased, (ii) any accrued and unpaid interest thereon through the date of repurchase, and (iii) any applicable make-whole amount. In addition, a future voluntary prepayment of our senior secured debt under the Fortress Credit Agreement will grant a holder of Convertible Notes the right, at its option, to require us to repurchase for cash a proportionate amount of the holder s Convertible Notes at a repurchase price equal to the sum of (a) the principal to be repurchased, (b) any accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the date of repurchase, and (c) any applicable make-whole amount. In the event certain other events occur or conditions exist, including the issuance of certain Indebtedness (as defined in the Convertible Note Purchase Agreement), certain asset dispositions, and certain issuances of equity, a holder of Convertible Notes will have the right, at its option, to require us to repurchase for cash a portion of the holder s Convertible Notes at a repurchase price equal to the sum of (x) the principal to be repurchased, (y) any accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the date of repurchase, and (z) any applicable make-whole amount. In the event certain cash flow thresholds are exceeded or certain proceeds of condemnation or insurance are received and not reinvested, a holder of Convertible Notes will have the right, at its option, to require us to repurchase for cash a portion of the holder s Convertible Notes at a repurchase price equal to the sum of (A) all of the principal to be repurchased, and (B) any accrued and unpaid interest thereon to or through, as applicable, the date of repurchase. 

The Convertible Notes will not be redeemable by us prior to the second anniversary of the issuance of the Convertible Notes. On or after such second anniversary, the Convertible Notes will be redeemable, in whole or in part, by us for cash, shares of our Common Stock or any combination thereof, at our option, if the last reported sale price of our Common Stock has been at least 130 of the triggering price then in effect for the 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption to the holders of Convertible Notes at a redemption price equal to (i) all of the principal to be redeemed, (ii) any accrued and unpaid interest thereon through the date of redemption, and (iii) any applicable make-whole amount. The current triggering price is 12.50 per share, which triggering price is subject to adjustment in the same manner and at the same times as the conversion price with respect to the Convertible Notes is adjusted pursuant to the terms of the Convertible Notes, except that no adjustment will be made to the triggering price in connection with the Stock Threshold Reduction. 

The terms of the Convertible Notes and the Convertible Note Purchase Agreement contain representations and warranties, events of default and affirmative and negative covenants, which include, among other things, certain restrictions on the ability to pay dividends, create liens, incur additional indebtedness, make investments, dispose of assets, consummate business combinations (except for permitted investments, as defined in the Convertible Note Purchase Agreement), and make distributions. In addition, financial covenants apply. Prior to the March 2022 Convertible Note Agreement Amendment, these financial covenants included (a) minimum liquidity of 5.0 million, (b) minimum last twelve-month revenue and (c) minimum last twelve-month EBITDA and certain other expenses including non-cash stock compensation, non-recurring costs in connection with the loan and Convertible Notes documentation and the Business Combination, warrant liabilities, and other noncash amortization expenses, in each case, determined in accordance with GAAP. Pursuant to the March 2022 Convertible Note Agreement Amendment, the financial covenants included in the Convertible Note Purchase Agreement were amended to increase the minimum liquidity requirement to an amount between 15.0 million and 20.0 million, depending on EBITDA performance levels and whether a default or event of default exists under the Convertible Note Purchase Agreement, and decrease the minimum last twelve-month revenue and EBITDA requirements. Pursuant to the May 2023 Fortress Note Purchase Amendment, the financial covenants included in the Fortress Note Purchase Agreement were amended to reduce the minimum liquidity requirement to a minimum of, prior to the closing of the Transaction, 2.0 million, and after the closing of the Transaction, 4.0 million. Revenue and EBITDA financial covenants are tested quarterly. The Convertible Notes are pari passu in right of payment and lien priority and are secured by a security interest in (a) all of the real, personal and mixed property in which liens are granted or purported to be granted pursuant to any of the collateral documents as security for the obligations, (b) all products, proceeds, rents and profits of such property, (c) all of each loan party s book and records and (d) all of the foregoing whether now owned or existing, in each case excluding certain excluded assets. 

70 

During the year ended December 31, 2023, we paid approximately 2.5 million in interest and 16.8 million in principal under the Convertible Notes. All debt owed by the Company to Fortress under the Fortress Credit Agreement and Convertible Notes under the Convertible Note Purchase Agreement is to be converted to equity under the terms of the Prepackaged Plan. 

Indemnification Agreements 

We have entered into separate indemnification agreements with our directors and executive officers, in addition to the indemnification provided for in the Certificate of Incorporation and our Bylaws. These agreements, among other things, require us to indemnify our directors and executive officers for certain expenses, including attorneys fees, judgments, fines and settlement amounts incurred by a director or executive officer in any action or proceeding arising out of their services as one of our directors or executive officers or as a director or executive officer of any other company or enterprise to which the person provides services at our request. We believe that these provisions and indemnification agreements are necessary to attract and retain qualified persons as directors and officers. 

The limitation of liability and indemnification provisions in the Certificate of Incorporation and our Bylaws may discourage stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against our directors for breach of their fiduciary duties. They may also reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors and officers, even though an action, if successful, might benefit us and our stockholders. A stockholder s investment may decline in value to the extent we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against directors and officers pursuant to these indemnification provisions. 

Prior to the Closing, Legacy Airspan and New Beginnings had also entered into customary indemnification agreements with all of their respective directors and executive officers. 

Legacy Airspan 

SoftBank 

On October 1, 2015, Legacy Airspan issued a warrant to SoftBank to purchase shares of Legacy Airspan s Series D Preferred Stock, par value 0.0001 per share, which was amended by Amendment No. 1, dated February 3, 2016, Amendment No. 2, dated July 1, 2016 and Amendment No. 3, dated July 3, 2017 (the SoftBank Warrant ). In connection with the Business Combination, on March 8, 2021, concurrently with the execution of the Business Combination Agreement, SoftBank and New Beginnings entered into the an irrevocable proxy agreement (the Proxy Agreement ), pursuant to which, among other things, SoftBank granted to the proxyholder named therein an irrevocable proxy and power of attorney with respect to any shares of Common Stock held by SoftBank representing in excess of 9.90 of our voting power in any applicable vote, consent, election, waiver or other action of our stockholders (the Subject Shares ). Pursuant to the Proxy Agreement the proxyholder named in the Proxy Agreement will vote the Subject Shares in the same manner and proportion as all other shares of stock entitled or eligible to vote on the applicable matter, excluding any shares of stock held by SoftBank and its affiliates. As consideration for, among other things, SoftBank s cooperation with, participation in, and consent to the Business Combination and the entry into the Proxy Agreement, Legacy Airspan and SoftBank agreed to amend and restate the SoftBank Warrant to, among other things, (i) reduce the purchase price to 45.9875 per share and (ii) provide for the automatic net exercise of the warrant upon the completion of the Business Combination. 

As further described above under Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions Airspan Amended Credit Agreement and Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions Airspan Convertible Notes , SoftBank has an indirect, non-controlling beneficial interest in Fortress, which is the agent and principal lender under the Fortress Credit Agreement and the collateral agent and trustee under the Convertible Note Purchase Agreement and the Convertible Notes, and also has an indirect, non-controlling beneficial interest in each Convertible Notes Purchaser. 

71 

SoftBank is a subordinated lender to Legacy Airspan under the term loan agreement, dated February 9, 2016, as amended by amendments thereto, including Amendment No. 5 thereto dated as of December 30, 2020 (the SoftBank Working Capital Agreement ). At December 31, 2022, there was approximately 41.5 million aggregate principal amount of indebtedness outstanding under the SoftBank Working Capital Agreement. The SoftBank Working Capital Agreement bears interest at a rate of 9 per annum. Since January 1, 2021, we have paid no principal and have accrued, but not yet paid any interest, under the SoftBank Working Capital Agreement. 

We derived approximately 0.4 million in revenue from sales of products and services to SoftBank from January 1, 2023 through December 31, 2023. 

Reliance 

We are a supplier of products to Reliance. Reliance has accounted for approximately 26.1 million of our revenues between January 1, 2023 through December 31, 2023. Prior to the Closing, Reliance held an aggregate of 162,602 shares of Legacy Airspan s Series D Preferred Stock. 

Related Party Transactions Policies 

Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics requires us to avoid, wherever possible, all related party transactions that could result in actual or potential conflicts of interests, except under guidelines approved by our Board (or the audit committee). A conflict-of-interest situation can arise when a person takes actions or has interests that may make it difficult to perform his or her work objectively and effectively. Conflicts of interest may also arise if a person, or a member of his or her family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of his or her position. 

Our audit committee, pursuant to its written charter, is responsible for reviewing and approving related-party transactions to the extent we enter into such transactions. The audit committee will consider all relevant factors when determining whether to approve a related party transaction, including whether the related party transaction is on terms no less favorable to us than terms generally available from an unaffiliated third-party under the same or similar circumstances and the extent of the related party s interest in the transaction. No director may participate in the approval of any transaction in which he or she is a related party, but that director is required to provide the audit committee with all material information concerning the transaction. We also expect to require each of our directors and executive officers to complete a directors and officers questionnaire that elicits information about related party transactions. 

These procedures are intended to determine whether any such related party transaction impairs the independence of a director or presents a conflict of interest on the part of a director, employee or officer. 

Director Independence 

NYSE American listing standards require that a majority of our board of directors be independent. An independent director is defined generally as a person other than an officer or employee of the company or its subsidiaries or any other individual having a relationship which in the opinion of the company s board of directors, would interfere with the director s exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. Our board of directors has determined that Messrs. Flynn and Jarvis are independent directors as defined in the NYSE American listing standards and applicable SEC rules. Our independent directors have regularly scheduled meetings at which only independent directors are present.
