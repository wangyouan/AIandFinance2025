Overview 

We
are engaging in the production and sale of food products, specifically dessert created and sold through various restaurants that we operate
in Malaysia. We sell our goods under our brand name Sweet Hut . The Company originally through indirect subsidiary SH Dessert
Sdn. Bhd. operates two restaurant outlets and one central kitchen in Malaysia. 

On
July 29, 2020, the Company decided to terminate two restaurant outlets in Setapak and Pandan Indah, 3-month notices were given to both
landlords, effective on August 1, 2020 onwards. As such, both restaurant outlets tenancy agreement expired on October 31, 2020 and no
longer carried any operation as of March 31, 2021. 

On
September 22, 2020, the Company decided to terminate restaurant outlets on Botanic and C180, 2-month notices were given to both landlords,
effective on September 28, 2020 onwards. As such, both restaurant outlets tenancy agreement expired on November 30, 2020 and no longer
carried any operation as of March 31, 2021. 

On
November 15, 2020, the Company entered into a new tenancy agreement with unrelated third party for a new shop located in C180, Cheras
through indirect wholly owned subsidiary SH Dessert Sdn. Bhd. for a tenancy period of two years. SH Dessert Sdn. Bhd. were given a rent-free
grace period of one month from November 15, 2020 to December 14, 2020, upon the expiration of rent-free grace period, the Company pays
a rental of MYR 6,000 (approximately 1,441) on monthly basis. As of March 31, 2021, renovation was completed and the branch was in operation. 

On

 3,602), expiring on January 31, 2024, with option to extend for another two years expiring on January 31, 2026 with a maximum increment
of not more than 15 .

We
started our business under the brand of Sweet Hut in 2010, the trademark for which registered and will remain valid until
March 25, 2020. We established our first outlet in Kuchai Lama, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. We started to manufacture various traditional
Chinese desserts such as black glutinous, almond, mango desserts and peanut butter. 

The
name Sweet Hut is derived from the word Sweetheart . Since food is known as the language of love, we ve
decided to use Sweetheart as our business s signature a dessert hut filled with love, passion integrity.
Sweet Hut aims to please customers by serving creative and exquisite desserts. 

In
2013, our company was awarded SME100 Award by SME Entrepreneurship Magazine. SME100 Awards is an annual recognition
programme organized by SME Magazine, naming the fastest moving businesses of the SME sector. To promote recognition of top businesses
in a lucrative and dynamic market, the SME100 Awards has served as a symbol which is believed to distinguish the best among the great. 

Since
2013, we have grown into a dessert manufacturer and dessert chain under our brand name of Sweet Hut in Malaysia. By the
end of 2020, the Company decided to shut down all four restaurants operation and re-establish two new restaurants under new concept to
strengthen the Company business branding and promoting, together with the launching of menu. 

We
operate one centralized kitchen and two restaurants located in Malaysia. We manufacture and process our own dessert and food in our centralized
kitchen with standard procedures and recipes, in order to ensure the food quality and safety for distribution. Our suppliers, including
raw material, ingredient, packaging material suppliers, are located in Malaysia. 

Most
of our centralized prepared dessert and food will be distributed to our restaurants through our logistic team delivery, via refrigerated
trucks. Restaurant is owned and operated by the Company with an internal operational manual in order to comply with all laws applicable
to operating a restaurant in Malaysia, which includes, but is not strictly limited to, the Food Act 1983, Food Regulations 1985 and Food
Hygiene Regulations 2009. 

In
2017, due to the increasing number of smartphone users and availability of online food delivery intermediaries, the Company decided to
take advantage of such opportunities. On July 4, 2017 and September 18, 2017, the Company, through SH Dessert Sdn. Bhd., which is the
restaurant operator, registered as a vendor to Honestbee food delivery and Foodpanda delivery. On November 22, 2018, the Company, through
SH Dessert Sdn. Bhd., registered with Grabfood as a vendor. On July 22, 2019, Honestbee food delivery suspended its operation in Malaysia
and we stopped our collaboration with Honestbee on the same day. The Company believes registering as a vendor to the aforementioned platforms
enables the Company to expand the coverage of availability of all our restaurants despite these platforms charging approximately 30 
commission on the total food bill on average. 

On
January 31, 2020, Lucky Star F B Sdn. Bhd., which is the centralized kitchen operator, has acquired the halal certificate on the
food process and production from JAKIM, also known as Department of Islamic Development Malaysia. According to the information from the
Department of Statistics Malaysia, as of 2019, the population in Malaysia was approximately 32.6 million, and 69.3 of the population
were Muslim adherents. With the halal certificate, we believe the Company can penetrate the Islamic food market in Malaysia, which may
lead to improvement in the Company s financial performance and position. 

The
Company has observed an increasingly competitive environment in the food and beverage industry due to the low barriers to entry and shift
in the paradigm of consumer behaviour and preference which the Company believes it is crucial to implement strategic rebranding and marketing
activities to cope with industry and consumer demand. For this purpose, in 2020, the Company has closed all of its four restaurants and
re-establish two new outlets locating in C180, Cheras and Sri Petaling and engaged branding firm, to advise on our marketing approach
including our brand new renovation outlook, dishes and menu with the funding from our public offering. 

We
strongly believe to excel in food and beverage industry, it is crucial to maintain the quality of food served to our customers, regardless
of whether that is through food delivery or dine in. To grow our business and build brand awareness it is crucial to improve the Company s
exposure in terms of availability to different locations throughout different towns. Currently, the Company s potential market
is limited to the two towns in which our restaurant is located. Even with the availability of online food delivery platforms, we believe
we are unable to attract customers located more than 20 kilometers away from our individual restaurants, which limits to our growth. 

On
October 31, 2022, the Company terminated all the tenancy agreements before the due date of the agreements. 

On
November 30, 2022, the Company has entered into a lease agreement with a third party, Sweet Bakery Dessert Cafe Sdn Bhd to lease
their assets to the third party. The leasing period is commencing from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023. The Company did not cease
its business operation nor sell the operating assets. The Company is looking for a new strategic location to continue their business
while leasing out their assets to the third party. 

On January 1, 2024, the Company disposed SEHL, which
indirectly resulted in the divestiture of two subsidiaries in Malaysia, Lucky Star and SH Dessert. The disposal of these subsidiaries
led to the discontinuation of the Company s asset leasing business. The Company has decided to shift its focus to providing consultancy
services to restaurant owners, specializing in restaurant and kitchen management. This strategic move leverages the Director s extensive
experience in the food and beverage industry. 

By offering expert guidance on various aspects of restaurant operations,
the consultancy aims to help restaurant owners optimize their business performance. Services may include improving kitchen efficiency,
menu planning, staff training, cost management, and implementing best practices for food safety and customer service. The Director s
deep industry knowledge and practical experience will be invaluable in delivering tailored solutions that address the unique challenges
encountered by restaurants. This new direction not only broadens the Company s service portfolio but also positions it as a valuable
consultant for restaurant owners seeking to enhance their operational effectiveness and profitability.

Company, through our subsidiary SH Dessert Sdn. Bhd. has been cooperating with online food delivery companies to have our desserts displayed
on their platforms in order to promote that our desserts may be delivered by their companies, such as Foodpanda and Grabfood.

every month. On October 31, 2022, the Company terminated all the tenancy agreements before the due date of the agreements. 

On
November 30, 2022, the Company has entered into a lease agreement with a third party, Sweet Bakery Dessert Cafe Sdn Bhd to lease

Controls and Procedures 

Disclosures
Control and Procedures 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the
 Exchange Act ), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file
or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities
and Exchange Commission s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including
our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. 

We
carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer,
of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2024. Based on the evaluation of these disclosure controls
and procedures, and in light of the material weaknesses found in our internal controls over financial reporting, our chief executive
officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. 

The
matters involving internal controls and procedures that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were: (1) lack of a functioning audit committee due to a lack of a majority of independent
members and a lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment
and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; (2) inadequate segregation of duties and effective risk assessment; (3)
insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application
of both US GAAP and SEC guidelines; and (4) lack of internal audit function due to the fact that the Company lacks qualified resources
to perform the internal audit functions properly and that the scope and effectiveness of the internal audit function are yet to be developed.
The aforementioned material weaknesses were identified by our chief executive officer in connection with the review of our financial
statements as of March 31, 2024. 

Internal
Control over Financial Reporting 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f)
and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. The internal controls for the Company are provided by executive management s review and approval
of all transactions. Our internal control over financial reporting also includes those policies and procedures that: 

Pertain to the maintenance
 of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 

Provide reasonable assurance
 that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
 generally accepted in the United States of America and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance
 with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 

Provide reasonable assurance
 regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company s assets that could
 have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Management
assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2024. In making this assessment,
management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated
Framework. Management s assessment included an evaluation of the design of our internal control over financial reporting and testing
of the operational effectiveness of these controls. 

15 

As
of March 31, 2024, management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective
internal control over financial reporting established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in 2013 and SEC guidance on conducting such assessments. Based on such
evaluation, the Company s management concluded that, during the period covered by this Report, our internal control over financial
reporting were not effective. 

Identified
Material Weaknesses 

A
material weakness in internal control over financial reporting is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, that
results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the financial statements will not be prevented or detected. 

Management
identified the following material weaknesses during its assessment of internal controls over financial reporting as of March 31, 2024. 

1. 
 We do not have an Audit
 Committee While not being legally obligated to have an audit committee, it is the management s view that such a
 committee, including a financial expert member, is an utmost important entity level control over the Company s financial statement.
 Currently the Chief Executive Officer and Director act in the capacity of the Audit Committee and does not include a member that
 is considered to be independent of management to provide the necessary oversight over management s activities. 

2. 
 We do not have Written
 Policies Procedures Due to lack of written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting, the
 Company did not establish a formal process to close our books monthly and account for all transactions and thus failed to properly
 record the Private Placement or disclose such transactions in its SEC filings in a timely manner. 

3. 
 We did not implement
 appropriate information technology controls As at March 31, 2024, the Company retains copies of all financial data and
 material agreements; however, there is no formal procedure or evidence of normal backup of the Company s data or off-site storage
 of the data in the event of theft, misplacement, or loss due to unmitigated factors. 

Accordingly,
the Company concluded that these control deficiencies resulted in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual
or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the company s internal controls. 

As
a result of the material weaknesses described above, management has concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control
over financial reporting as of March 31, 2024 based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by
COSO. 

16 

Management s
Remediation Initiatives 

Since
2021, we engaged Dude Business Consultants Limited as an external consultant to assist with the identification and address of complex
and proper accounting issues. 

In
an effort to remediate the identified material weaknesses and other deficiencies and enhance our internal controls, we also plan to initiate
the following series of measures to further strengthen the Company s internal controls going forward: 

1. 
 hire a reporting manager
 Internal Finance Manager who has the requisite relevant U.S. GAAP and SEC reporting experience and qualifications; 

2. 
 make an overall assessment
 on the current finance and accounting resources and hire additional accounting members with appropriate levels of accounting knowledge
 and experience; 

3. 
 streamline our accounting
 department structure and enhance our staff s U.S. GAAP and SEC reporting requirements on a continuous basis through internal
 training provided by the Internal Finance manager; 

4. 
 participate in trainings
 and seminars provided by professional services firms on a regular basis to gain knowledge on regular U.S. GAAP / SEC reporting requirements
 updates; and 

5. 
 engage an external Sarbanes-Oxley
 404 consulting firm to help us implement Sarbanes-Oxley 404 internal controls compliance together with the establishment of
 our internal audit function. 

We
anticipate that these initiatives will be at least partially, if not fully, implemented by the end of fiscal year 2024.

the selection of outside auditors, reviewing the scope, results and effectiveness of the annual audit of the Company s financial
statements and other services provided by the Company s independent public accountants. The Board of Directors, the Chief Executive
Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of the Company review the Company s internal accounting controls, practices and policies.

Committees
of the Board 

Our
Company currently does not have nominating, compensation, or audit committees or committees performing similar functions nor does our
Company have a written nominating, compensation or audit committee charter. Our Director believes that it is not necessary to have such
committees, at this time, because the Director can adequately perform the functions of such committees. 

Audit
Committee Financial Expert 

Our
Board of Directors has determined that we do not have a board member that qualifies as an audit committee financial expert 
as defined in Item 407(D)(5) of Regulation S-K, nor do we have a Board member that qualifies as independent as the term
is used in Item 7(d)(3)(iv)(B) of Schedule 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and as defined by Rule 4200(a)(14)
of the FINRA Rules. 

We
believe that our Director(s) are capable of analyzing and evaluating our financial statements and understanding internal controls and
procedures for financial reporting. The Director(s) of our Company does not believe that it is necessary to have an audit committee because
management believes that the Board of Directors can adequately perform the functions of an audit committee. In addition, we believe that
retaining an independent Director who would qualify as an audit committee financial expert would be overly costly and burdensome
and is not warranted in our circumstances given the stage of our development and the fact that we have not generated any positive cash
flows from operations to date. 

Involvement
in Certain Legal Proceedings 

Our
Directors and our Executive officers have not been involved in any of the following events during the past ten years: 

1. 
 bankruptcy petition filed
 by or against any business of which such person was a general partner or executive officer either at the time of the bankruptcy or
 within two years prior to that time; 
 
 2. 
 any conviction in a criminal

 or 
 
 4. 
 being found by a court

 5. 
 Such person was found by
 a court of competent jurisdiction in a civil action or by the Commission to have violated any Federal or State securities law, and
 the judgment in such civil action or finding by the Commission has not been subsequently reversed, suspended, or vacated; 

19 

6. 
 Such person was found by
 a court of competent jurisdiction in a civil action or by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to have violated any Federal commodities
 law, and the judgment in such civil action or finding by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has not been subsequently reversed,
 suspended or vacated; 
 
 7. 
 Such person was the subject
 of, or a party to, any Federal or State judicial or administrative order, judgment, decree, or finding, not subsequently reversed,
 suspended or vacated, relating to an alleged violation of: (i) Any Federal or State securities or commodities law or regulation;
 or(ii) Any law or regulation respecting financial institutions or insurance companies including, but not limited to, a temporary
 or permanent injunction, order of disgorgement or restitution, civil money penalty or temporary or permanent cease-and-desist order,
 or removal or prohibition order; or(iii) Any law or regulation prohibiting mail or wire fraud or fraud in connection with any business
 entity; or 
 
 8. 
 Such person was the subject
 of, or a party to, any sanction or order, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any self-regulatory organization (as
 defined in Section 3(a)(26) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(26))), any registered entity (as defined in Section 1(a)(29) of
 the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 1(a)(29))), or any equivalent exchange, association, entity or organization that has disciplinary
 authority over its members or persons associated with a member. 

Independence
of Directors 

We
are not required to have independent members of our Board of Directors, and do not anticipate having independent Directors until such
time as we are required to do so. 

Code
of Ethics 

We
have not adopted a formal Code of Ethics. The Board of Directors evaluated the business of the Company and the number of employees and
determined that since the business is operated by a small number of persons, general rules of fiduciary duty and federal and state criminal,
business conduct and securities laws are adequate ethical guidelines. In the event our operations, employees and/or Directors expand
in the future, we may take actions to adopt a formal Code of Ethics. 

Shareholder
Proposals 

Our
Company does not have any defined policy or procedural requirements for shareholders to submit recommendations or nominations for Directors.
The Board of Directors believes that, given the stage of our development, a specific nominating policy would be premature and of little
assistance until our business operations develop to a more advanced level. Our Company does not currently have any specific or minimum
criteria for the election of nominees to the Board of Directors and we do not have any specific process or procedure for evaluating such
nominees. The Board of Directors will assess all candidates, whether submitted by management or shareholders, and make recommendations
for election or appointment. 

A
shareholder who wishes to communicate with our Board of Directors may do so by directing a written request addressed to our President,
at the address appearing on the first page of this Information Statement.

SECTION
16(A) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE

to file reports regarding ownership of, and transactions in, our securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission and to provide
us with copies of those filings. Based solely on our review of the copies of such forms furnished to us and written representations by
our officers and directors regarding their compliance with applicable reporting requirements under Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act,
we believe that all Section 16(a) filing requirements for our executive officers, directors and 10 stockholders were met during the

to more efficient operations in the long term.

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Synergy Empire Limited (the Company as of March 31, 2024
and March 31, 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income /(loss), consolidated statements of
changes in stockholders equity, and consolidated statements of cash flows for the year ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023,
and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, and the results
of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits,
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error
or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Going
concern 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming
that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, for the year ended
March 31, 2024, the Company incurred a negative operating cash flow of 132,747. The Company s current liabilities exceeded its
current assets by 406,879, has an accumulated deficit of 958,879 and shareholders deficit of 406,879. These conditions raise
substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters
are also described in Note 3. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome
of this uncertainty. 

Critical
Audit Matters 

Critical
audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be
communicated to the Board of Directors (Those Charged with Governance) that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material
to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgements. We determined that there
are no critical matters.
