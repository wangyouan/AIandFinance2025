 CAUTIONARY
STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This
Annual Report on Form 10-K may contain forward-looking statements which include assumptions about future market conditions, operations
and financial results. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. They are made pursuant
to safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The Company s actual results, performance or
achievements in the future could differ significantly from the results, performance or achievements discussed or implied in such forward-looking
statements herein and in prior U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC filings by the Company. The Company assumes
no obligation to update these forward-looking statements or to advise of changes in the assumptions on which they were based. 
 Factors
that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, changes in the competitive environment of the Company,
general economic and business conditions, industry trends, changes in government rules and regulations and environmental rules and regulations.
Statements concerning interest rates and other financial instrument fair values and their estimated contribution to the Company s
future results of operations are based upon market information as of a specific date. This market information is often a function of
significant judgment and estimation. Further, market interest rates are subject to potential significant volatility. 
 ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS. 
 Risks
Relating to Ownership Structure 
 The
controlling shareholder group may be able to vote its shares in favor of its interests that may not always coincide with the interests
of shareholders not part of such group. This risk may be counter-balanced to a degree by the actions of the Company s Board of
Directors (the Board which is made up of a majority of independent directors. 
 
 1 

 Table of Contents 

The
controlling shareholder group includes a corporation that owns a significant percentage of the Company s common stock and which
does business with the Company, as further described in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain conflicts of interest
may be perceived by the relationship between the Company and its largest shareholder. Nevertheless, the Company and its largest shareholder
have put in place some controls to reduce the effects of any perceived conflict of interest, including ensuring that the Board is composed
of a majority of independent directors. 
 Risks
Related to Our Business and Operations 
 We
are a part of the communities in which we do business. Accordingly, like other businesses in our communities, we are subject to the following
risks: 

changes in the rate of economic growth, and interest rates both nationally and locally; 

the ability to obtain additional financing at reasonable costs and interest rates; 

changes in the financial condition of our customers; 

changes in the regulatory environment and particularly burdens of increasing local, state, and federal requirements and taxes; 

lease cancellations and particularly loss of key tenants; 

changes in our estimates of costs; 

loss of key personnel; 

war and/or terrorist attacks could significantly impact buildings leased to tenants; 

the continued availability of insurance for various policies at reasonable rates; 

outcomes of pending and future litigation; 

increasing competition by other companies; 

compliance with our loan covenants; 

climate change; 

recoverability of claims against our customers and others by us and claims by third parties against us; 

changes in estimates used in our critical accounting policies; 

cybersecurity threats or incidents; and 

pandemics and the related trends of office versus remote work practices. 

Our
investment in property development may be limited by increasing costs required to make improvements to property leased to tenants. Also,
as the cost of fitting up properties increases, we may be required to wait and forsake opportunities that would be revenue producing
until such time that we obtain the necessary financing of such ventures. This risk may be mitigated by obtaining lines of credit and
other financing vehicles, although such have significant limitations on the amounts that may be borrowed at any point in time. 
 We
also may be subject to environmental liability as an owner or operator of properties. Many of our properties are old and when we need
to fit up a property for a new tenant, we may find materials and the like that could be deemed to contain hazardous elements requiring
remediation or encapsulation. 
 Since
2020, the demand for commercial real estate rental space has declined. As online retail operations continue to expand nationwide, retailers
are facing increased competition which reduces the need for the leasing of properties. Remote work since the pandemic has resulted in
tenants careful evaluation and reduction of office space needs and a decline in demand of commercial office space rentals from
increasing competition. The Company emphasizes retention of tenants over a long period of time which helps in difficult economic conditions.
The Company also aggressively markets available space to tenants including governmental agencies, medical, industrial, and educational
institutions.

 Table of Contents 

We
try to lease our properties to tenants with adequate finances. As a result of the current high interest rate environment and less liquidity
available to smaller businesses, even formerly financially strong tenants may be at risk. The Company mitigates the risk of tenants with
less than adequate finances by leasing our properties to multiple tenants, where applicable, in order to diversify the tenant base. 
 ITEM
1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS. 
 Not
Applicable. 
 ITEM
1C. CYBERSECURITY. 
 Risk
Management and Strategy 
 We
have implemented and maintain various information security processes designed to identify, assess, and manage material risks from cybersecurity
threats to our critical computer networks, hardware, software, third-party hosted services, and data. 
 We
rely on third-party service providers to help manage our information systems, including network security service providers with experienced
information technology professionals. We also work with third parties to identify, assess, and manage actual and perceived cybersecurity
threats and risks, and we evaluate cybersecurity risk as part of our overall risk management strategy. With the assistance of these third-party
service providers, we implement and maintain various technical, physical, and administrative controls and processes to manage and mitigate
material risks from cybersecurity threats to our information systems. This includes procedures for incident detection and response, network
security controls, access controls, physical security, systems monitoring, and backup and recovery procedures. 
 Our
operations rely on third-party service providers and software programs. For instance, our accounting and financial reporting-related
systems use software obtained from third-party service providers, and these systems are necessary for the efficient and consistent operation
of our business. We use these systems to communicate with tenants, banks, vendors, and others, and to manage our accounting, financial
reporting, and for other recordkeeping purposes. We, thus, maintain a process to identify and evaluate cybersecurity risks and incidents
associated with key third-party providers. When utilizing third-party software for key services, we seek to engage those that are reliable,
reputable, and maintain cybersecurity controls. To address risks associated with third-party providers for critical services, we review
available audit reports of controls from such providers to assess and manage any identified risks. 
 Notwithstanding
the effort we place on cybersecurity, we may not be successful in preventing or mitigating a cybersecurity incident that could have a
material adverse effect on the Company. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we are not aware of any cybersecurity threats
or incidents which have materially affected or are likely to materially affect our Company, results of operations, or financial condition. 
 Governance 
 Our
Board of Directors maintains oversight responsibility of risks from cybersecurity threats. This oversight is facilitated primarily through
the Audit Committee (the Committee ), which is responsible for oversight of our information system risk, including cybersecurity
threats. The Committee oversees the risk management program designed to implement adequate controls to mitigate cybersecurity risks.
 
 The
Committee receives periodic updates from management on potential risks, threats, and controls to mitigate identified risks. The Committee
reports to the full Board of Directors regarding its activities, including those related to cybersecurity. The full Board of Directors
also receives briefings from management on the cybersecurity risk management program as needed. 
 Our
management, represented by our Chief Financial Officer, Ward Lyke, provides leadership for implementation and maintenance of our cybersecurity
risk management processes. Mr. Lyke has served as Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Treasurer since January 2024, and as an
Executive Vice President and Officer of the Company since 1984, including as Assistant Treasurer since 2003. Mr. Lyke currently manages
key functions

monthly report with key IT systems data and statistics, including red flags requiring resolution, if any. Management reports serious
cybersecurity incidents to the Committee and our Board.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 

(A)
EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 

 The
Company s management reviewed the Company s internal controls and procedures and the effectiveness of these controls. As
of July 31, 2024, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision of, and with the participation of the Company s
management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of
the Company s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rules 13a-14(c) and 15d-14(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s
disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to the Company required to
be included in its periodic SEC filings. 

 (B)
CHANGE TO INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. 

 There was no change
in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting or in other factors during the Company s last fiscal quarter that
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal controls over financial reporting. There
were no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses noted, and therefore there were no corrective actions taken. 

 (C)
MANAGEMENT S ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. 

 The Company s
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined
in Rule 13(a)-15(f). Our internal control system has been designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company s management and
its Board regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. All internal control systems, no matter how
well designed, have inherent limitations. Even those systems that have been determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance
with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. The Company s management assessed the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2024. In making this assessment, the Company s management used the criteria set
forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control Integrated Framework published
in 2013. Based on the Company s assessments, we believe that, as of July 31, 2024, its internal control over financial reporting
is effective based on these criteria. 

 This Form 10-K Annual
Report does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal controls over financial
reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to the
exemption for non-accelerated filers from the internal control audit requirement of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.

 THE
COMPANY 

 J.W. Mays, Inc. was
founded in 1924 and incorporated under the laws of the State of New York on July 6, 1927. 

 The Company operates
a number of commercial real estate properties located in Brooklyn and Jamaica in New York City; in Levittown and Massapequa, Long Island,
New York; in Fishkill, Dutchess County, New York; and in Circleville, Ohio. The major portions of these properties are owned and the balance
is leased. A substantial percentage of these properties are leased to tenants while the remainder is available for lease. 

 More comprehensive information
concerning the Company appears in its Form 10-K Annual Report for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2024. 

 J.W.
MAYS, INC. 

 TO
OUR SHAREHOLDERS: 

 Remote work and on-line
shopping trends, which surged during the pandemic, continue to have a significant nationwide effect on office and retail commercial real
estate rentals. Even with ongoing reduced nationwide and local demand for office and retail rentals, local real estate taxes in New York
City have increased while costs of inflation were higher than anticipated. Financial results this past year include: 

In 2024 the Company s net loss increased to (406,568), or (.20) per share from (82,964), or
 (.04) per share primarily due to a decrease in rental income; partially offset by a decrease in real estate operating expenses, a decrease
in interest expense, net of capitalized interest, and a realized gain on the sale of marketable securities. 

Revenues in 2024 decreased to 21,593,264 from 22,576,455 in the comparable 2023 year primarily due
to the loss of a tenant in March 2023, a decrease in rent revenue from two tenants occupying less space compared to the prior year: partially
offset by rent increases from existing tenants and new leases from several new tenants. 

Despite a loss in 2024 and 2023, the Company increased cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash by
 67,866 in fiscal 2024 compared with a 147,838 increase in the 2023 fiscal year. Cash flows from operations were 1,434,730 in fiscal
2024 compared with 2,221,910 in 2023. Cash provided by operating activities in 2024 and 2023 combined with proceeds from sales of marketable
securities in 2024 and 2023 were used to fund acquisition of property and equipment and reduce mortgages payable from 2023 to 2024. 

 Our strategy of pursuing
and entering into leases with governmental agencies and health care providers as tenants, as well as a significant educational institution
in our Fishkill building, and our ability to retain significant tenants over a long period of time, continues to serve our Company well. 

 As Brooklyn continues
to become a borough of choice for many individual s residences, businesses are also slowly shifting from Manhattan to the outer
boroughs. With our long history of resilience when facing difficult market conditions, I believe New York City and our Company will continue
moving forward from these challenging economic times. 

 I specifically want
to thank Mays personnel and our Board colleagues for their ongoing commitment and support, our shareholders for their continuing
belief in our Company and its future and our tenants for their continuing loyalty to our Company.

 The
Company s real estate operations include leased properties under long-term, non-cancelable operating lease agreements. The leases
expire at various dates through 2073, including options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain the Company will
exercise that option. Certain leases provide for increases in future minimum annual rental payments as defined in the lease agreements. 
 In
April 2023, the Company exercised one of four five-year option periods with its landlord to extend the Jamaica Avenue at 169th Street,
Jamaica, New York property lease beyond May 31, 2030 for a total of five years through . The effect of the five-year lease
extension on the measurement of operating right-of-use assets, liabilities, and monthly rent expense follows: 

As
of July 31, 2024, it is not reasonably certain the remaining three options to extend the lease from May 31, 2035 to May 31, 2050 will

The
Company has a federal net operating loss carryforward approximating and as of July 31, 2024 and July 31, 2023,
respectively, available to offset future taxable income. As of July 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had unused net operating loss carryforwards
of approximately for state, and for city, available to offset future taxable income. The net operating loss carryforwards
will begin to expire, if not used, in 2035. 
 New
York State and New York City taxes are calculated using the higher of taxes based on income or the respective capital based franchise
taxes. Beginning with the Company s tax year ended July 31, 2025, changes in the law required the state capital based tax will
be phased out. New York City taxes will be based on capital for the foreseeable future. Capital-based franchise taxes are recorded to
administrative and general expense. State tax amounts in excess of the capital-based franchise taxes are recorded to income tax expenses.
Due to both the application of the capital-based tax and due to the possible absence of city taxable income, the Company does not record
city deferred taxes. 
 Generally,
tax returns filed are subject to audit for three years by the appropriate taxing jurisdictions. The statute of limitations in each of
the state jurisdictions in which the Company operates remain open until the years are settled for federal income tax purposes, at which
time amended state income tax returns reflecting all federal income tax adjustments are filed. In July, 2024, 
 
 the
Internal Revenue Service initiated a one year examination of the tax year ending July 31, 2022. Subsequent year(s) may also be subject
to examination depending upon the outcome of the current examination. The Company does not expect the income tax audit in progress to
have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 
 Significant
components of the Company s deferred tax assets and liabilities as of July 31, 2024 and 2023 are a result of temporary differences
related to the items described as follows: 

Operating lease liabilities 

Federal net operating loss carryforward 

State net operating loss carryforward 

Unbilled receivables 

Property and equipment 

Unrealized loss on marketable securities 

Operating lease right-of-use assets 

Other 

Net deferred tax liability 

Management
periodically assesses the realization of its net deferred tax assets by evaluating all available evidence, both positive and negative,
associated with the Company and determining whether, based on the weight of that associated evidence, a valuation allowance for the deferred
tax assets is needed. Based on this analysis, management has determined that it is more likely than not that future taxable income will
be sufficient to fully utilize the federal and state deferred tax assets at July 31, 2024. 
 Components
of the deferred tax provision (benefit) for the years ended July 31, 2024 and 2023 consist of the following:

 REPORT
OF MANAGEMENT 
 Management
is responsible for the preparation and reliability of the financial statements and the other financial information in this Annual Report.
Management has established systems of internal control over financial reporting designed to provide reasonable assurance that the financial
records used for preparing financial statements are reliable and reflect the transactions of the Company and that established policies
and procedures are carefully followed. The Company reviews, modifies and improves its system of internal controls in response to changes
in operations. 
 The
Board of Directors, acting through the Audit Committee, which is comprised solely of independent directors who are not employees of the
Company, oversees the financial reporting process. The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting standards
generally accepted in the United States of America and include amounts based on judgments and estimates made by management. Actual results
could differ from estimated amounts. 
 To
ensure complete independence, Prager Metis CPAs, LLC, the independent registered public accounting firm, has full and free access to
meet with the Audit Committee, without management representatives present, to discuss results of the audit, the adequacy of internal
controls and the quality of financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

 To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of 
J.W. Mays, Inc. 

 Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 

 We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of J.W. Mays, Inc. (the Company as of July 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, changes in shareholders equity and cash flows for the years ended July 31, 2024 and 2023, and related notes and financial
statement schedules (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of July 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash
flows for the years ended July 31, 2024 and 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. 

 Basis for Opinion 

 These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our
audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required
to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations
of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

 We conducted our audit in accordance with
the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we
engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

 Our audit included performing procedures
to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that
respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

 Critical Audit Matter 

 The critical audit matter communicated below
is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to
the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our
especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our
opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate
opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 

 Valuation of Impairment of Properties 

 Critical Audit Matter Description 

 As described in Note 1 to the financial statements,
the Company reviews its owned and leased property for potential impairment when certain events or changes in circumstances indicate the
carrying amount may not be recoverable. Those events and circumstances include, but are not limited to, significant changes in real estate
market conditions, estimated residual values, and an expectation to sell assets before the end of the previously estimated life. In evaluating
property and equipment for indicators of impairment, management considers undiscounted future cash flows, including the residual value
of the real estate, with the carrying amount of the individual asset. Considering estimated future cash flows requires management to make
assumptions about the probabilities of various outcomes relating to market conditions, estimated holding periods, capitalization rates,
and potential proceeds if a property was sold. We identified the evaluation of impairment of properties as a critical audit matter. 
 
 20 

The principal consideration for our determination that the evaluation of
impairment was a critical audit matter was a higher risk of estimation uncertainty due to sensitivity of management judgments not only
regarding indicators of impairment but also regarding estimates and assumptions utilized in considering cash flows for cost recoverability
and making fair value measurements. 

 How the Critical Audit Matter was addressed in Our Audit 

 Our audit procedures related to the evaluation of impairment included the
following, among others. We obtained an understanding of the relevant controls over management s evaluation of potential property
impairments, such as controls over the Company s monitoring of the property, controls over the Company s consideration of
future cash flows, and controls over the Company s estimates of fair value. In consideration of impairment indicator criteria established
in management s accounting policies over impairment, we evaluated the completeness of the population of properties requiring further
analysis. We examined and evaluated the Company s undiscounted cash flows and estimates of fair value over properties identified
for potential impairment. We evaluated the reasonableness of the methods and significant assumptions used, including probabilities of
outcomes, holding periods, capitalization rates, and potential proceeds if a property was sold. We evaluated these items in comparison
with historical performance of the impacted properties and with comparable observable market data. Our assessment included evaluation
of these assumptions, and we considered whether such assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. 

 /s/ 

 We have served as the Company s auditor since 2020.

and us refer to J.W. Mays, Inc. and subsidiaries. 

 FORWARD
LOOKING STATEMENTS 

 The following can be
interpreted as including forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The words outlook ,
 intend , plans , efforts , anticipates , believes , expects 
or words of similar import typically identify such statements. Various important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially
from those expressed in the forward-looking statements are identified under the heading Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking
Statements below. Our actual results may vary significantly from the results contemplated by these forward-looking statements based
on a number of factors including, but not limited to, availability of labor, marketing success, competitive conditions and the change
in economic conditions of the various markets we serve. 

 CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 

 Critical accounting
policies are defined as those most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results and require the most
difficult, subjective or complex judgments. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements, the reported amount of revenues, and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities. We believe the critical accounting policies in Note 1 affect our more significant judgments and
estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements. Estimates are based on historical experience, where applicable or other
assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. We have identified the policies described below as our critical
accounting policies. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. 

 Impairment 

 The Company periodically reviews owned and leased properties, including
related long lived assets and depreciable lives, for indicators of impairment that imply the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable
through operations plus estimated disposition proceeds. Such indicators of impairment include, but are not limited to, significant changes
in real estate market conditions resulting in decreases in estimated fair values of properties or assets, changes in business conditions
in the industries in which our tenants operate, and other significant or unusual events or circumstances which may occur from time to
time. 

 If indicators of impairment existed, the carrying value of the property
would be written down to its estimated fair value based on our best estimate of the property s discounted future cash flows. 

 As of July 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company has determined there was no impairment
of its owned and leased properties, and the related carrying values, including depreciable lives. 

22 

FISCAL
2024 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2023 

 Net loss for the year
ended July 31, 2024 amounted to (406,568) or (.20) per share, compared to net loss for the year ended July 31, 2023 of (82,964) or
 (.04) per share primarily due to a decrease in rental income; partially offset by a decrease in real estate operating expenses, a decrease
in interest expense, net of capitalized interest, and a realized gain on the sale of marketable securities. 

 Revenues in the current
year decreased to 21,593,264 from 22,576,455 in the comparable 2023 year primarily due to the loss of a tenant who agreed to terminate
their lease effective March 31, 2023, decrease in rent revenue from two tenants occupying less space compared to the prior year: partially
offset by rent increases from existing tenants and new leases from several new tenants. 

 Real estate operating
expenses in the current year decreased to 15,151,406 from 15,383,378 in the comparable 2023 year primarily due to decreases in rent
expense for the Jamaica, New York lease, maintenance expense, and employee payroll costs; partially offset by increases in real estate
taxes and insurance expense. 

 Administrative and general
expenses in the current year increased to 5,336,672 from 5,280,853 in the comparable 2023 year primarily due to higher legal and professional
fees, less recoveries of bad debt in the current period, as recoveries resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic are now mostly complete; offset
by reductions in payroll and benefit costs in the current period. 

 Depreciation expense
in the current year increased to 1,725,291 from 1,688,557 in the comparable 2023 year primarily from improvements completed over the
last two years at the Company s various buildings. 

 Other income (loss)
and interest expense of 76,537 improved significantly in the current year from (368,631) in the comparable 2023 year. Net realized gain
on the sale of marketable securities for the year ended July 31, 2024, including liquidation of the remaining marketable securities in
May 2024, aggregated 124,907. In addition, the Company had less interest expense, net of capitalized interest in the current year due
to a reduction in mortgages payable balance from the prior year.

 Source of Funds; Cash Flows
from Financing Activities; Company Indebtedness 

 Including the estimated
costs to complete improvements mentioned above, the Company anticipates incurring an additional 2.2 million in capital expenditures over
the next twelve months ending July 31, 2025. The Company s primary source of liquidity is 1) cash provided by operations, and 2)
borrowings. Total liquidity as of July 31, 2024 consists of cash and cash equivalents of 1,243,977. Total liquidity includes proceeds
from fixed rate borrowings as of July 31, 2024. In addition, the Company s plans include securing an additional line of credit,
if needed, with an affiliated entity, Weinstein Enterprises, Inc. Weinstein ), principally owned by the Chairman of the
Board of Directors of both the Company and Weinstein. 

 To obtain more favorable
terms, the Company plans to refinance an existing 3,393,720 mortgage. Currently, anytime after April 1, 2025 through April 1, 2040, the
bank may demand a balloon payment for the full amount outstanding. For a more detailed description of the Company s indebtedness,
see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this 2024 Annual Report to Shareholders. 

 We believe our sources
of liquidity described above will be sufficient to meet our obligations as of July 31, 2024, and over the next 12 months. 

25 

Future Liquidity 

 The Company s
ability to increase cash flows from operations, and to obtain additional sources of borrowings is dependent on many factors such as the
continuously evolving local and macroeconomic commercial real estate markets, the effects of the overall economy, fluctuating interest
rates, inflation, trends of office versus remote work practices, city state regulations, and increasing real estate tax assessments.
There is no assurance the Company will be successful in securing additional sources of financing when needed. 

 RELATED
PARTY TRANSACTIONS: 

 The Company has two
operating leases with Weinstein Enterprises, Inc. Landlord ), an affiliated company, principally owned by the Chairman of
the Board of Directors of both the Company and Landlord. One lease is for building, improvements, and land located at Jamaica Avenue at
169 th Street, Jamaica, New York. Another lease is for premises located at 504-506 Fulton Street, Brooklyn, New York. 

 In April 2023, the Company
exercised one of four five-year option periods with its Landlord to extend the Jamaica Avenue at 169 th Street, Jamaica, New
York property lease beyond May 31, 2030 for a total of five years through May 31, 2035. As of July 31, 2024, it is not reasonably
certain the remaining three options to extend the lease from May 31, 2035 to May 31, 2050 will be exercised by the Company.

cause business conditions and our results to differ materially from what is contained in forward-looking statements: 

changes in the rate of economic growth, and interest rates both nationally and locally; 

the ability to obtain additional financing at reasonable costs and interest rates; 

changes in the financial condition of our customers; 

changes in the regulatory environment and particularly burdens of increasing local, state, and federal requirements and taxes; 

lease cancellations and particularly loss of key tenants; 

changes in our estimates of costs; 

loss of key personnel; 

war and/or terrorist attacks could significantly impact buildings leased to tenants;

compliance with our loan covenants; 

climate change; 

recoverability of claims against our customers and others by us and claims by third parties against us;

 CLAWBACK POLICY

EXHIBIT 97 

EXHIBIT 97 

 J.W. MAYS, INC.
CLAWBACK POLICY 

 I. BACKGROUND 

J.W. Mays, Inc. (the Company has adopted this policy Policy to provide for the recovery or clawback of certain incentive compensation in the event of a Restatement. This Policy is intended
to comply with, and will be interpreted to be consistent with, the requirements of Section 10D of the Exchange Act, Rule 10D-1. Certain
terms used in this Policy are defined in Section VIII. below. 

 II. STATEMENT OF POLICY 

 The Company shall recover reasonably promptly the
amount of erroneously awarded Incentive-Based Compensation in the event that the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement
due to the material noncompliance of the Company with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, including any required
accounting restatement to correct an error in previously issued financial statements that is material to the previously issued financial
statements, or that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the
current period (a Restatement ). 

 The Company shall recover erroneously awarded Incentive-Based
Compensation in compliance with this Policy except to the extent provided under Section V. below. 

III. SCOPE OF POLICY 

A. Covered Persons and Recovery Period . This Policy applies to Incentive-Based Compensation received by a person: 

after beginning service as an Executive Officer, 

who served as an Executive Officer at any time during the performance period for that Incentive-Based Compensation, 

while the Company has a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange, and 

during the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the date that the Company is required to prepare a Restatement (the
 Recover y Period ). 

 Notwithstanding this
look-back requirement, the Company is only required to apply this Policy to Incentive-Based Compensation received on or after
January 1, 2024. 

 For purposes of this Policy, Incentive-Based
Compensation shall be deemed received in the Company's fiscal period during which the Financial Reporting Measure (as defined
herein) specified in the Incentive-Based Compensation award is attained, even if the payment or grant of the Incentive-Based Compensation
occurs after the end of that period. 

B. D. Method of Recovery. The Compensation Committee of the Board (the Committee will have discretion
in determining how to accomplish recovery of erroneously awarded Incentive-Based Compensation under this Policy, recognizing that different
means of recovery may be appropriate in different circumstances. 

 IV. AMOUNT SUBJECT TO RECOVERY 

 The amount of Incentive-Based Compensation subject to recovery under this
Policy is the amount of Incentive-Based Compensation received that exceeds the amount of Incentive-Based Compensation that otherwise would
have been received had it been determined based on the restated amounts, computed without regard to any taxes paid or payable. 

V. EXCEPTIONS 

 The Company shall recover erroneously awarded Incentive-Based
Compensation in compliance with this Policy except to the extent that the conditions set out below are met and the Committee has made
a determination that recovery would be impracticable: 

A. Direct Expense Exceeds Recoverable Amount. The direct expense paid to a third party to assist in enforcing
this Policy would exceed the amount to be recovered; provided, however, that before concluding it would be impracticable to recover any
amount of erroneously awarded Incentive-Based Compensation based on expense of enforcement, the Company shall make a reasonable attempt
to recover such erroneously awarded Incentive-Based Compensation, document such reasonable attempt(s) to recover, and maintain that documentation
as required by regulatory authorities. 

B. Recovery from Certain Tax-Qualified Retirement Plans . Recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement
plan, under which benefits are broadly available to employees of the Company, to fail to meet the requirements of 26 U.S.C. 401(a)(13)
or 26 U.S.C. 411(a) and regulations thereunder. 

 VI. PROHIBITION AGAINST INDEMNIFICATION 

 Notwithstanding the terms of any indemnification arrangement
or insurance policy with any individual covered by this Policy, the Company shall not indemnify any Executive Officer or former Executive
Officer against the loss of erroneously awarded Incentive-Based Compensation, including any payment or reimbursement for the cost of insurance
obtained by any such covered individual to fund amounts recoverable under this Policy. 

 VII. DISCLOSURE 

 The Company shall file all disclosures with respect
to this Policy and recoveries under this Policy in accordance with the requirements of the U.S. Federal securities laws, including the
disclosure required by the applicable Securities and Exchange Commission SEC filings. 

 VIII. DEFINITIONS 

 Unless the context otherwise requires, the following
definitions apply for purposes of this Policy: 

 Executive Officer means the
Company s president, principal financial officer, any vice-president of the Company or any other officer who performs a policy-making
function, or any other person who performs similar policymaking functions for the Company. Policy-making function is not intended to include
policymaking functions that are not significant. Identification of an Executive Officer for purposes of this Policy will include at a
minimum executive officers identified pursuant to 17 CFR 229.401(b). 

 Financial Reporting Measures 
means any measures that are determined and presented in accordance with the accounting principles used in preparing the Company s
financial statements. A Financial Reporting Measure need not be presented within the Company s financial statements or included
in a filing with the SEC. 

 Incentive-Based Compensation means
any compensation that is granted or earned based wholly or in part upon the attainment of a Financial Reporting Measure. 

 IX. EFFECTIVENESS 

 This Policy shall be effective as of January 1, 2024.
