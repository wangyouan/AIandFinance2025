 Life Sciences and Applied Markets Products and Applications 
 Our products fall into the following main areas of work: liquid chromatography, gas chromatography, mass spectrometry, spectroscopy, software and informatics, lab automation and robotics, vacuum technology, remarketed instruments and chemistries and supplies. 
 
 Our key products and applications include the following technologies: 
 
 Liquid Chromatography 
 
 A liquid chromatograph, high-performance liquid chromatograph ("HPLC") or ultra-high performance liquid chromatograph UHPLC is used to separate molecules of a liquid mixture to determine the quantity and identity of the molecules present. The Agilent LC portfolio is largely modular in construction and can be configured as analytical and preparative systems. These systems can be stepwise upgraded to highly sophisticated, automated workflow solutions such as method development, multi method/walk-up, high-capacity/high-throughput or multi dimensional LC and can be extended to application based analyzers (e.g., for bio-molecular separations, chiral analysis or size exclusion chromatography). As a leader in liquid chromatography, we continue to expand our application space with new HPLC columns, new services and ongoing instrument and software product enhancements. 
 
 Gas Chromatography 
 
 Agilent is the world's leading provider of gas chromatographs, both laboratory and portable models. Gas chromatographs are used to separate any gas, liquid or solid that can be vaporized and then detect the molecules present to determine their identity and quantity. Agilent provides custom or standard analyzers configured for specific chemical analysis applications, such as detailed speciation of a complex hydrocarbon stream, calculation of gas calorific values in the field, or analysis of a new bio-fuel formulation. We also offer related software, accessories and consumable products for these and other similar instruments. 
 
 Mass Spectrometry 
 
 A mass spectrometer MS identifies and quantifies compounds based on their molecular mass and characteristic patterns of fragment ion masses that result when a molecule is broken apart. MS is an important tool in analyzing a broad spectrum of analytes, from small molecules, such as pesticides, to large molecules, such as intact proteins and other biological entities. Liquid chromatography ("LC") and gas chromatography ("GC") are commonly used to separate compounds and introduce them to the MS system. Agilent's LCMS portfolio includes instruments built around four main analyzer types - single quadrupole, triple quadrupole, time-of-flight ("TOF") and quadrupole time-of-flight ("QTOF"). Agilent's GC/MS portfolio includes instruments built around three main analyzer types - single quadrupole, triple quadrupole, and quadrupole time-of-flight ("QTOF"). We significantly expanded our mass spectrometry portfolio in recent years with a focus on improving performance, sensitivity, precision, robustness, ease of use and onboard intelligence.

The following discussions of Research and Development, Backlog, Intellectual Property, Materials, Environmental, Regulatory Affairs and Human Capital Management include information common to each of our businesses. 
 
 Research and Development 
 
 We anticipate that we will continue to have significant research and development expenditures in order to maintain our competitive position with a continuing flow of innovative, high-quality products and services. Our research and development efforts focus on potential new products and product improvements covering a wide variety of technologies, none of which is individually significant to our operations. Our research seeks to improve on various technical competencies in software, systems and solutions. In each of these research fields, we conduct research that is focused on specific product development for release in the short-term as well as other research that is intended to be the foundation for future products over a longer time-horizon. Most of our product development research is designed to improve products already in production, focus on major new product releases, and develop new product segments for the future. We remain committed to invest significantly in research and development and have focused our development efforts on key strategic opportunities to align our business with available markets and position ourselves to capture market share. 

Backlog 
 
 We believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects for our business segments since a significant portion of our revenue for a given quarter is derived from the current quarter's orders. Therefore, we believe that backlog information is not material to an understanding of our business. 

Intellectual Property 
 
 We generate patent and other intellectual property rights covering significant inventions and other innovations in order to create a competitive advantage. While we believe that our licenses, patents and other intellectual property rights have value, in general no single license, patent or other intellectual property right is in itself material. In addition, our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or may otherwise not provide significant competitive advantage. 

Materials 
 
 Our life sciences and applied markets, diagnostics and genomics and Agilent CrossLab businesses all purchase materials from thousands of suppliers on a global basis. Some of the parts that require custom design work are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work. Our long-term relationships with suppliers allow us to proactively manage technology road maps and product discontinuance plans and monitor their financial health. To address any potential disruption in our supply chain, we use a number of techniques, including qualifying multiple sources of supply and redesign of products for alternative components. In addition, while we generally attempt to keep our inventory at minimal levels, we do purchase incremental inventory as circumstances warrant to protect the supply chain.

 Environmental 
 
 Our research and development, manufacturing and distribution operations involve the use of hazardous substances and are regulated under international, federal, state and local laws governing health and safety and the environment. We apply strict standards for protection of the environment and occupational health and safety to sites inside and outside the U.S., even if not subject to regulation imposed by foreign governments. We believe that our properties and operations at our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and occupational health and safety laws. We are also regulated under a number of international, federal, state, and local laws regarding recycling, product packaging and product content requirements. We believe we are substantially in compliance with such environmental, product content/disposal and recycling laws. We also maintain a comprehensive Environmental Site Liability insurance policy which may cover certain clean-up costs or legal claims related to environmental contamination. This policy covers specified active, inactive and divested locations. 
 
 Climate change may impact our business by increasing operating costs due to impairments of our facilities and distribution systems, disruptions to our manufacturing processes and additional regulatory requirements. Although we address these potential risks in our business continuity planning, such events could make it difficult for us to deliver products and services to our customers and cause us to incur substantial expense. 
 
 In addition to monitoring and managing compliance with environmental regulations, we strive to advance our sustainability practices. In 2021, we announced our goal to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. In 2023, we announced near and long term greenhouse gas emission reduction targets which were validated by the Science Based Targets initiative ("SBTi"). We also aim to provide transparency on our approach to sustainability management through our annual ESG report. 

Regulatory Affairs 
 
 A number of our products and services are subject to regulation by the FDA, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies. These regulations govern a wide variety of product and service related activities, from quality management, design and development to manufacturing, labeling, promotion, sales and distribution. If we fail to comply with FDA regulations and other applicable regulatory requirements or are perceived to potentially have failed to comply, we may face, among other things, warning letters; adverse publicity; investigations or notices of non-compliance, fines, injunctions, and civil or criminal penalties; import or export restrictions; partial suspensions or total shutdown of production facilities or the imposition of operating restrictions; suspension or revocation of our license to operate; increased difficulty in obtaining required FDA clearances or approvals or foreign equivalents; seizures or recalls of our products or those of our customers; or the inability to sell our products. In Europe, the European Union has started to enforce new requirements, known as the EU In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation EU IVDR ), which imposes stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of in vitro diagnostics in the European Union. These regulations are more stringent in a variety of areas, including clinical evidence requirements, quality management systems and post-market surveillance activities. The EU IVDR requirements became effective starting in May 2022. 
 
 We are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts, and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers. We have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and, as a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government. We are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts. A failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts, criminal, civil and administrative penalties or debarment. 
 
 We are also subject to various significant international, federal, state and local regulations in the areas of health and safety, packaging, product content, employment, labor and immigration, import/export controls, trade restrictions and anti-competition. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, restrictions on our business conduct and on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our brand, our ability to attract and retain employees, our international operations, our business and our operating results. 
 
 In addition, as a global organization, we are subject to data privacy and security laws, regulations, and customer-imposed controls in numerous jurisdictions as a result of having access to and processing confidential, personal, sensitive and/or patient health data in the course of our business. Global privacy laws, including the EU's General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR ), Brazil s Lei Geral de Protecao de Dados , China's Personal Information Protection Law and Data Security Law, and the California Consumer Privacy Act, apply to our activities involving the processing of personal data, both in relation to our product and service offerings and the management of our workforce. The global proliferation of privacy laws, with governmental authorities around the world passing or considering passing legislative and regulatory proposals concerning 
 14 

Table of Contents 

 privacy and data protection, continues to result in new requirements regarding the handling of personal data, with many such laws imposing significant penalties for non-compliance (including possible fines of up to four percent of total company revenue under the GDPR). Each of these privacy, security and data protection laws and regulations could impose significant limitations and increase our cost of providing our products and services where we process end user personal data and could harm our results of operations and expose us to significant fines, penalties and other damages. 
 
 While we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with such laws and regulations, any noncompliance could result in substantial fines or otherwise restrict our ability to operate and thereby have an adverse effect on our financial condition. To date, none has had a material impact on our operations. 

Human Capital Management 
 
 As of October 31, 2024, we employed approximately 17,900 persons, of whom approximately 7,000 were based in the Americas, 4,400 in Europe and 6,500 in Asia Pacific. We also leverage temporary workers to provide flexibility for our business and manufacturing needs.

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 Business and Strategic Risks 
 General economic conditions may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. 
 
 Our business is sensitive to negative changes in general economic conditions, both inside and outside the United States. Slower global economic growth, increasing interest rates, inflationary pressures, instability and uncertainty in the markets in which we operate may adversely impact our business resulting in: 
 
 reduced demand and longer sales cycle for our products, delays in the shipment of orders, or increases in order cancellations; 
 increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories; 
 increased price pressure for our products and services; and 
 greater risk of impairment to the value, and a detriment to the liquidity, of our investment portfolio.

Our operating results and financial condition could be harmed if the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated. 
 
 Visibility into our markets is limited. Our quarterly sales and operating results are highly dependent on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter, which are difficult to forecast and may be cancelled by our customers. In addition, our revenue and earnings forecasts for future fiscal quarters are often based on the expected seasonality of our markets. However, the markets we serve do not always experience the seasonality that we expect as customer spending policies and budget allocations, particularly for capital items, may change. Any decline in our customers' markets or in general economic conditions has in the past and may in the future result in a reduction in demand for our products and services. Also, if our customers' markets decline, we may not be able to collect on outstanding amounts due to us. Such declines could harm our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows and stock price, and could limit our profitability. Also, in such an environment, pricing pressures could intensify. Since a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to sales, research and development and manufacturing costs, if we were unable to respond quickly enough, these pricing pressures could further reduce our operating margins. 
 
 If we do not introduce successful new products and services in a timely manner to address increased competition through frequent new product and service introductions, rapid technological changes and changing industry standards, our products and services may become obsolete, and our operating results may suffer. 
 
 We generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by increased competition through frequent new product and service introductions, rapid technological changes and changing industry standards. Without the timely introduction of new products, services and enhancements, our products and services may become technologically obsolete over time, in which case our revenue and operating results could suffer. The success of our new products and services will depend on several factors, including our ability to: 
 
 properly identify customer needs and predict future needs; 
 innovate and develop new technologies, services and applications; 
 appropriately allocate our research and development spending to products and services with higher growth prospects; 
 successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner; 
 manufacture and deliver new products in sufficient volumes and on time; 
 differentiate our offerings from our competitors' offerings; 
 price our products competitively; 
 anticipate our competitors' development of new products, services or technological innovations; and 
 control product quality in our manufacturing process. 
 
 In addition, if we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies, we may invest in research and development of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue, which would adversely affect our profitability. Even if we successfully innovate and develop new and enhanced products and services, we may incur substantial costs in doing so, and our operating results may suffer. In addition, promising new products may fail to reach the market or realize only limited commercial success because of real or perceived concerns of our customers. Furthermore, as we collaborate with pharmaceutical customers to develop drugs such as companion diagnostics assays or provide drug components like active pharmaceutical ingredients, we face risks that those drug programs may be cancelled upon clinical trial failures.

Economic, political, foreign currency and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations. 
 
 Because we sell our products worldwide, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. We anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent a majority of our total revenue. International revenue and costs are subject to the risk that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our financial results when translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. Overall, foreign currency movements for the year ended October 31, 2024, had no overall impact on revenue growth when compared to the same period last year. Typically, when movements in foreign currency exchange rates have a negative impact on revenue, they will also have a positive impact by reducing our costs and expenses. In addition, many of our employees, contract manufacturers, suppliers, job functions, outsourcing activities and manufacturing facilities are located outside the United States. Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including: 
 
 interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers; 
 ongoing instability or changes in a specific country's or region's political, economic or other conditions, including inflation, recession, interest rate fluctuations and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts, including uncertainties and instability in economic and market conditions caused by pandemics like COVID-19, the current conflicts in Ukraine/Russia and the Middle East, and political and trade uncertainties in the greater China region; 
 changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, as well as new tariffs, trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, new or different customs duties, trade embargoes and sanctions and other trade barriers; 
 tariffs imposed by the U.S. on goods from other countries and tariffs imposed by other countries on U.S. goods, including the tariffs enacted by the U.S. government on various imports from China and by the Chinese government on certain U.S. goods; 
 negative consequences from changes in or differing interpretations of laws and regulations, including those related to tax and import/export; 
 difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations; 
 differing labor regulations; 
 differing protection of intellectual property; 
 unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; 
 geopolitical uncertainty or turmoil, terrorism and war; and 
 impact of public health crises, including pandemics and epidemics, such as COVID-19, on the global economy. 
 
 We sell our products into many countries and we also source many components and materials for our products from and manufacture our products in various countries. Future tariffs and tariffs already implemented could have negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. It may be time-consuming and expensive for us to alter our business operations in order to adapt to any such change. Further, additional tariffs, the scope and duration of which, if implemented, remains uncertain, which have been proposed or threatened and the potential escalation of a trade war and retaliatory measures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 Most of our accounting and tax processes including general accounting, cost accounting, accounts payable, accounts receivable and tax functions are centralized at locations in India and Malaysia. If economical, political, health or other conditions change in those countries, it may adversely affect operations, including impairing our ability to pay our suppliers and collect our receivables. Our results of operations, as well as our liquidity, may be adversely affected and possible delays may occur in reporting financial results. 
 
 In addition, a significant amount of certain types of expenses, such as payroll, utilities, tax, and marketing expenses, are paid in local currencies. Our hedging programs reduce, but do not always entirely eliminate, within any given twelve-month period, the impact of currency exchange rate movements, and therefore fluctuations in exchange rates, including those caused by currency controls, could impact our business, operating results and financial condition by resulting in lower revenue or increased expenses. For expenses beyond that twelve-month period, our hedging strategy does not mitigate our exposure. In addition, our currency hedging programs involve third-party financial institutions as counterparties. The weakening or failure of financial institution counterparties may adversely affect our hedging programs and our financial condition through, among other things, a reduction in available counterparties, increasingly unfavorable terms, and the failure of the counterparties to perform under hedging contracts.

 Demand for some of our products and services depends on the capital spending policies of our customers, research and development budgets and on government funding policies. 
 
 Our customers include pharmaceutical companies, laboratories, universities, healthcare providers, government agencies and public and private research institutions. Many factors, including public policy spending priorities, available resources, mergers and consolidations, institutional and governmental budgetary policies and spending priorities, and product and economic cycles, have a significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities. Fluctuations in the research and development budgets at these organizations could have a significant effect on the demand for our products and services. Research and development budgets fluctuate due to changes in available resources, consolidation, spending priorities, general economic conditions, medical reimbursement policies and institutional and governmental budgetary policies. The timing and amount of revenue from customers that rely on government or research funding may vary significantly due to factors that can be difficult to forecast, including changes in spending authorizations and budgetary priorities for our products and services. If demand for our products and services is adversely affected, our revenue and operating results would suffer. 
 
 Failure to adjust our purchases due to changing market conditions or failure to accurately estimate our customers' demand could adversely affect our income. 
 
 Our income could be harmed if we are unable to adjust our purchases to reflect market fluctuations, including those caused by the seasonal nature of the markets in which we operate. The sales of our products and services are dependent, to a large degree, on customers whose industries are subject to seasonal trends in the demand for their products. During a market upturn, we may not be able to purchase sufficient supplies or components to meet increasing product demand, which could materially affect our results. In the past, we have experienced a shortage of parts for some of our products. In addition, some of the parts that require custom design are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work. Should a supplier cease manufacturing such a component, we would be forced to reengineer our product. In addition to discontinuing parts, suppliers may also extend lead times, limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. In order to secure components for the production of products, we may enter into non-cancelable purchase commitments with vendors, or at times make advance payments to suppliers, which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to declining market demands. If demand for our products is less than we expect, we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional expenses. 
 
 Our business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel. 
 
 Our future success depends partly on the continued service of our key research, engineering, sales, marketing, manufacturing, executive and administrative personnel. If we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel, we will not be able to maintain or expand our business. We believe our pay levels are very competitive within the regions that we operate. However, there is intense competition for certain highly technical specialties in geographic areas where we continue to recruit, and it may become more difficult to hire and retain our key employees. 
 
 Our strategic initiatives to adjust our cost structure could have long-term adverse effects on our business, and we may not realize the operational or financial benefits from such actions. 
 
 We have implemented multiple strategic initiatives across our businesses to adjust our cost structure, and we may engage in similar activities in the future. These strategic initiatives and our regular ongoing cost reduction activities may distract management, could slow improvements in our products and services and limit our ability to increase production quickly if demand for our products increases. In addition, delays in implementing our strategic initiatives, unexpected costs or failure to meet targeted improvements may diminish the operational and financial benefits we realize from such actions. Any of the above circumstances could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results and financial condition. 
 
 Our acquisitions, strategic investments and alliances, joint ventures, exiting of businesses and divestitures may result in financial results that are different than expected. 
 
 In the normal course of business, we frequently engage in discussions with third parties relating to possible acquisitions, strategic investments and alliances, joint ventures and divestitures, and generally expect to complete several transactions per year. In addition, we may decide to exit a particular business within our product portfolio. As a result of such transactions, our financial results may differ from our own or the investment community's expectations in a given fiscal quarter or over the long term. We may have difficulty developing, manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a way that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines. Acquired businesses may also expose us to new risks and new markets, and we may have difficulty addressing these risks in a cost effective and timely manner. Transactions such as acquisitions have resulted, and may in the future result in, unexpected significant costs and expenses. In the future, we 
 20 

Table of Contents 

 may be required to record charges to earnings during the period if we determine there is an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets, up to the full amount of the value of the assets, or, in the case of strategic investments and alliances, consolidate results, including losses, of third parties or write down investment values or loans and convertible notes related to the strategic investment. 
 
 Integrating the operations of acquired businesses within Agilent could be a difficult, costly and time-consuming process that involves a number of risks. Acquisitions and strategic investments and alliances may require us to integrate and collaborate with a different company culture, management team, business model, business infrastructure and sales and distribution methodology and assimilate and retain geographically dispersed, decentralized operations and personnel. Depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition, our successful integration of the entity depends on a variety of factors, including introducing new products and meeting revenue targets as expected, the retention of key employees and key customers, increased exposure to certain governmental regulations and compliance requirements and increased costs and use of resources. Further, the integration of acquired businesses is likely to result in our systems and internal controls becoming increasingly complex and more difficult to manage. Any difficulties in the assimilation of acquired businesses into our control system could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations. 
 
 Even if we are able to successfully integrate acquired businesses within Agilent, we may not be able to realize the revenue and other synergies and growth that we anticipated from the acquisition in the time frame that we expected, and the costs of achieving these benefits may be higher than what we expected. As a result, the acquisition and integration of acquired businesses may not contribute to our earnings as expected, we may not achieve our operating margin targets when expected, or at all, and we may not achieve the other anticipated strategic and financial benefits of such transactions. 
 
 A successful divestiture depends on various factors, including our ability to effectively transfer liabilities, contracts, facilities and employees to the purchaser, identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to keep and reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business. In addition, if customers of the divested business do not receive the same level of service from the new owners, this may adversely affect our other businesses to the extent that these customers also purchase other Agilent products. In exiting a business, we may still retain liabilities associated with the support and warranty of those businesses and other indemnification obligations. All of these efforts require varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations. If we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of such transactions, our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows and stock price could be negatively impacted. 
 
 The impact of consolidation and acquisitions of competitors is difficult to predict and may harm our business. 
 
 The life sciences industry is intensely competitive and has been subject to increasing consolidation. Consolidation in our industries could result in existing competitors increasing their market share through business combinations and result in stronger competitors, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to compete successfully in increasingly consolidated industries and cannot predict with certainty how industry consolidation will affect our competitors or us. 
 
 Public health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic may adversely impact, and pose risks to, certain elements of our business, results of operations and financial condition, the nature and extent of which are highly uncertain and unpredictable. 
 
 Our global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises, including epidemics and pandemics such as COVID-19. Public health crises, and any related remediation measures such as quarantine, curfew and other travel and activity restrictions, may impact our operations and sales and delivery of products and services. Our supply chain has in the past and may in the future be impacted, and we could experience disruptions or delays in shipments of certain materials or components of our products. We may be unable to accurately predict the full extent and duration of the impact of a public health crisis on our business and operations due to numerous uncertainties, including the duration and severity of the crisis, the efficacy and distribution of vaccines, containment measures and additional waves of infection.

 Regulatory, Legal and Compliance Risks 
 
 If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, which could lead to a loss of investor confidence in our financial statements and have an adverse effect on our stock price. 
 
 Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial statements and to effectively prevent fraud. We devote significant resources and time to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 and continue to enhance our controls. However, we cannot be certain that we will be able to prevent future significant deficiencies or material weaknesses. Inadequate internal controls could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on investor confidence in our financial statements, the trading price of our stock and our access to capital. 
 
 Our customers and we are subject to various governmental regulations. Compliance with or changes in such regulations may cause us to incur significant expenses, and if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain regulations, we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution, and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties. 
 
 Our customers and we are subject to various significant international, federal, state and local regulations, including but not limited to regulations in the areas of health and safety, packaging, product content, employment, labor and immigration, import/export controls, trade restrictions and anti-competition. In addition, as a global organization, we are subject to data privacy and security laws, regulations, and customer-imposed controls in numerous jurisdictions as a result of having access to and processing confidential, personal, sensitive and/or patient health data in the course of our business. Global privacy laws, including the EU's General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR ), Brazil s Lei Geral de Protecao de Dados, the California Consumer Privacy Act and China s Personal Information Protection Law and Data Security Law, apply to our activities involving the processing of personal data, both in relation to our product and service offerings and the management of our workforce. The global proliferation of privacy laws, with governmental authorities around the world passing or considering passing legislative and regulatory proposals concerning privacy and data protection, continues to result in new requirements regarding the handling of personal data and when personal data may be transferred outside the country where it was collected. Many such laws impose significant penalties for non-compliance (including possible fines of up to four percent of total company revenue under the GDPR or orders to stop processing personal data in a particular jurisdiction). Each of these privacy, security and data protection laws and regulations could impose significant limitations and increase our cost of providing our products and services where we process personal data and could harm our results of operations and expose us to significant fines, penalties and other damages. 
 
 We must also comply with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, anti-competition regulations and sanctions imposed by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control and other similar laws and regulations. Such laws demand that we implement, test, and monitor an effective compliance program in order to detect and prevent instances of non-compliance. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, suspension of government contracts or debarment, restrictions on our business conduct and on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our brand, our ability to attract and retain employees, our international operations, our business and our operating results. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate our policies. 
 
 These regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. We may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations or to remedy any violations of these regulations. Any failure by us to comply with applicable government regulations could also result in the cessation of our operations or portions of our operations, product recalls or impositions of fines, suspension of government contracts or debarment, and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations. In addition, because many of our products are regulated or sold into regulated industries, we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products. We develop, configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations. Any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for our products, force us to modify our products to comply with new regulations or increase our costs of producing these products. If demand for our products is adversely affected or our costs increase, our operating results and business would suffer. 
 
 Our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies, like the International Standards Organization, as well as regulation by other agencies such as the FDA. We also must comply with work safety rules. If we fail to adequately address any of these regulations, our businesses could be harmed. 
 22 

Table of Contents 

We are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies, and failure to comply with such regulations could harm our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 A number of our products and services are subject to regulation by the FDA, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies. In addition, a number of our products and services may in the future be subject to regulation by the FDA and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies. These regulations govern a wide variety of product and service-related activities, from quality management, design and development to manufacturing, labeling, promotion, sales and distribution. In addition, we are subject to inspections by these and other regulatory authorities. If we or any of our suppliers, distributors or customers fail to comply with FDA regulations and other applicable regulatory requirements or are perceived to potentially have failed to comply, we may face, among other things, warning letters; adverse publicity affecting both us and our customers; investigations or notices of non-compliance, fines, injunctions, and civil or criminal penalties; import or export restrictions; partial suspensions or total shutdown of production facilities or the imposition of operating restrictions; suspension or revocation of our license to operate, increased difficulty in obtaining required FDA clearances or approvals or foreign equivalents; seizures or recalls of our products or those of our customers; or the inability to sell our products. Any such FDA or other regulatory agency actions could disrupt our business and operations, lead to significant remedial costs and have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. In addition, the global regulatory environment has become increasingly stringent for our products and services. For example, the EU has started to enforce new requirements, known as the EU In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation (the EU IVDR ), which imposes stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of in vitro diagnostics in the European Union. These new regulations are more stringent in a variety of areas, including clinical evidence requirements, quality management systems and post-market surveillance activities. The new EU IVDR requirements became effective starting in May 2022. Failure to meet these requirements could adversely impact our business in the EU and other regions that tie their product registrations to the EU requirements. 
 
 Some of our products are subject to particularly complex regulations such as regulations of toxic substances, and failure to comply with such regulations could harm our business. 
 
 Some of our products and related consumables are used in conjunction with chemicals whose manufacture, processing, distribution and notification requirements are regulated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency EPA under the Toxic Substances Control Act ("TSCA") and by regulatory bodies in other countries under similar laws, to prevent unreasonable risks to human health or the environment. Under the TSCA, the EPA has authority to require reporting, record-keeping and testing, and to implement restrictions relating to chemical substances and/or mixtures. The TSCA prohibits persons from manufacturing (domestic production or importation of) any chemical in the United States that has not been reviewed by the EPA for its effect on health and safety or which is not listed on the EPA TSCA chemical substance inventory. We must ensure conformance of the manufacturing, storing, processing, distribution of and notification about these chemicals to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in all applicable countries as these requirements change. If we fail to comply with the notification, record-keeping and other requirements in the manufacture or distribution of our products, then we could be subject to civil penalties, criminal prosecution and, in some cases, prohibition from distributing or marketing our products until the products or component substances are brought into compliance. 
 
 Our business may suffer if we fail to comply with government contracting laws and regulations. 
 
 We derive a portion of our revenue from direct and indirect sales to U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign governments and their respective agencies. Such contracts are subject to various procurement laws and regulations and contract provisions relating to their formation, administration and performance. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations or provisions in our government contracts could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties, suspension of government contracts or debarment, termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, increased pricing pressure or suspension from future government contracting. If our government contracts are terminated, if we are suspended from government work, or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected, our business could suffer.

 Our reputation, ability to do business and financial statements may be harmed by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents or business partners. 
 
 Our internal controls and compliance systems may not always protect us from acts committed by employees, agents or business partners of ours (or of businesses we acquire or partner with) that would violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, kickbacks and false claims, pricing, sales and marketing practices, conflicts of interest, competition, employment practices and workplace behavior, export and import compliance, money laundering and data privacy. In particular, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree. Any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the United States and in other jurisdictions, and related shareholder lawsuits could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees. In addition, the government may seek to hold us liable as a successor for violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire. We also rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier standards of conduct, and material violations of such standards of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our business, reputation and financial statements. 
 
 We are subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure expectations and regulations that impact compliance costs and risks of noncompliance. 
 
 We are subject to changing rules and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental and self-regulatory organizations, including the SEC and NYSE, as well as evolving investor expectations around corporate governance and environmental and social practices and disclosures. These rules and regulations continue to evolve in scope and complexity, and many new requirements have been created in response to laws enacted by the U.S., local and foreign governments, making compliance more difficult and uncertain. The increase in costs to comply with such evolving expectations, rules and regulations, as well as any risk of noncompliance, could adversely impact us. 
 
 In addition, we face increasing scrutiny from stakeholders with respect to environmental, social and governance ESG practices and disclosures. Also, various legal and regulatory requirements specific to ESG matters in the U.S., EU, local or other jurisdictions in which we operate are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent. For instance, we are subject to various laws against forced labor which have been promulgated by many regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions where we operate. Any failure to adequately address stakeholder expectations with respect to ESG matters may result in an adverse impact on our business, financial results, stock price or reputation. Our ability to achieve our current and future ESG goals is uncertain and remains subject to numerous risks, including evolving regulatory requirements and stakeholder expectations, our ability to recruit and retain a diverse workforce, the availability of suppliers and other business partners that can meet our ESG expectations and standards, cost considerations and the development and availability of cost-effective technologies or resources that support our ESG goals. 
 
 Environmental contamination from past and ongoing operations could subject us to substantial liabilities. 
 
 Certain properties we have previously owned or leased are undergoing remediation for subsurface contamination. Although we are indemnified for liability relating to the required remediation at some of those properties, we may be subject to liability if these indemnification obligations are not fulfilled. In other cases, we have agreed to indemnify the current owners of certain properties for liabilities related to contamination, including companies with which we have previously been affiliated such as HP, Inc., Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (formerly Hewlett-Packard Company) and Siemens Healthineers (formerly Varian Medical Systems, Inc.). Further, other properties we have previously owned or leased at which we have operated in the past, or for which we have otherwise contractually assumed or provided indemnities, certain actual or contingent environmental liabilities, may or do require remediation. While we are not aware of any material liabilities associated with any potential environmental contamination at any of those properties or facilities, we may be exposed to material liability if environmental contamination at material levels is found to exist. In addition, in connection with the acquisition of certain companies, we have assumed other costs and potential or contingent liabilities for environmental matters. Any significant costs or liabilities could have an adverse effect on results of operations.

Table of Contents 

 We are subject to environmental laws and regulations that expose us to a number of risks and could result in significant liabilities and costs. 
 
 Our current and historical manufacturing and research and development processes and facilities are subject to various foreign, federal, state and local environment protection and health and safety laws and regulations. As a result, we may become subject to liabilities for environmental contamination, and these liabilities may be substantial. Although our policy is to apply strict standards for environmental protection and health and safety at our sites inside and outside the United States, we may not be aware of all conditions that could subject us to liability. Further, in the event that any future climate change legislation would require that stricter standards be imposed by domestic or international environmental regulatory authorities, we may be required to make certain changes and adaptations to our manufacturing processes and facilities. We cannot predict how changes will affect our business operations or the cost of compliance to us, our customers or our suppliers. Failure to comply with these environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations could result in civil, criminal, regulatory, administrative or contractual sanction, including fines, penalties or suspensions, restrictions on our operations and reputational damage. If we have any violations of, or incur liabilities pursuant to these laws or regulations, our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected. 
 
 Issues in the development, deployment, and use of artificial intelligence technologies in our business operations, services and products may result in reputational harm, regulatory action, or legal liability, and any failure to adapt to such technological developments or industry trends could adversely affect the competitiveness of our business . 
 
 We are integrating artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies AI into our business operations, products and services, while continuing to explore the opportunities that AI could bring to the company. The use of AI, particularly generative AI, presents opportunities as well as risks that could negatively impact the business. The development, deployment, and use of AI, including within the life sciences industry, is still in its early stages, where the use of insufficiently developed AI technologies and premature deployment practices could result in unintended outcomes that harm the business. AI technologies may be developed using inaccurate, incomplete, flawed or biased algorithms, training methodologies or data, which could result in competitive harm, regulatory penalties, legal liability, or brand or reputational harm. Further, a failure to timely and effectively use or deploy AI and integrate it into new product offerings and services could negatively impact our competitiveness, particularly ahead of evolving industry trends and evolving consumer demands. We may be unable to devote adequate financial resources to develop or acquire new AI technologies and systems in the future. 
 
 Use of AI to improve internal business operations, or in the development or provision of products or services, poses risks and challenges. AI can pose risks from an intellectual property, confidential data leakage, data protection, privacy perspective, as well as raise ethical concerns, compliance issues, and security risks. The input of confidential information or trade secrets into AI systems may result in the loss of intellectual property, proprietary rights, or attorney-client privilege in such information or trade secrets. The use of AI technologies for developing products or services may adversely affect or preclude the company s intellectual property rights in such products or services, or may expose the company to liability related to the infringement, misappropriation or other violation of third-party intellectual property. The use of AI technologies with personally identifiable information may also result in legal liability. Further, particularly given the nascent stage of the technology, the use of AI can lead to unintended consequences, including the generation of outputs that appear correct but are factually inaccurate, misleading, or that result in unintended biases and discriminatory outcomes, or are otherwise flawed, which could harm our reputation and business and expose us to risks related to such inaccuracies or errors in these outputs. 
 
 Moreover, AI is subject to a dynamic and rapidly evolving legal and regulatory environment, which, without appropriate review, governance and risk management, could expose the company to unforeseen legal or regulatory scrutiny and liabilities. As such, it remains uncertain how AI laws and regulations will impact our business or the associated cost or risks related to compliance therewith or with respect to embedding compliance mechanisms appropriately and effectively into our operations. The use of AI may be subject to new legal or regulatory requirements, the impact of which may be prohibitive or pose further risks from a legal or regulatory action perspective. 
 
 Third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property, and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services. 
 
 From time to time, third parties may claim that one or more of our products or services infringe their intellectual property rights. We analyze and take action in response to such claims on a case by case basis. Any dispute or litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming due to the complexity of our technology and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. A claim of intellectual property infringement could force us to enter into a costly or restrictive license agreement, which might not be available under acceptable terms or at all, could require us to redesign our products, which would be costly and time-

 consuming, and/or could subject us to significant damages or to an injunction against the development and sale of certain of our products or services. Our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim, or negotiating a license, in response to a claim of intellectual property infringement. In certain of our businesses, we rely on third-party intellectual property licenses, and we cannot ensure that these licenses will continue to be available to us in the future or can be expanded to cover new products on favorable terms or at all. 
 
 Third parties may infringe our intellectual property, and we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights. 
 
 Our success depends in large part on our proprietary technology, including technology we obtained through acquisitions. We rely on various intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements, to establish, maintain and enforce our proprietary rights. If we do not enforce our intellectual property rights successfully, our competitive position may suffer, which could harm our operating results. 
 
 Our pending patent, copyright and trademark registration applications may not be allowed, or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents, copyrights or trademarks. In addition, our patents, copyrights, trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us with a significant competitive advantage. 
 
 We may need to spend significant resources monitoring and enforcing our intellectual property rights, and we may not be aware of or able to detect or prove infringement by third parties. Our competitive position may be harmed if we cannot detect infringement and enforce our intellectual property rights quickly or at all. In some circumstances, we may choose to not pursue enforcement because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons. In addition, competitors might avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing non-infringing competing technologies. Intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries, which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share and could result in lost revenues. Furthermore, some of our intellectual property is licensed to others which may allow them to compete with us using that intellectual property. 
 
 Operational Risks 
 
 Our operating results may suffer if our manufacturing capacity does not match the demand for our products. 
 
 Because we cannot immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to rapidly changing market conditions, when demand does not meet our expectations, our manufacturing capacity may exceed our production requirements. If during an economic downturn we had excess manufacturing capacity which could occur due to our plans to expand certain manufacturing capacities, then our fixed costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity would adversely affect our gross margins and operating results. If, during a general market upturn or an upturn in one of our segments, we cannot increase our manufacturing capacity to meet product demand, we may not be able to fulfill orders in a timely manner which could lead to order cancellations, contract breaches or indemnification obligations. This inability could materially and adversely limit our ability to improve our results. 
 
 If we are unable to successfully manage the consolidation and streamlining of our manufacturing operations, we may not achieve desired efficiencies, and our ability to deliver products to our customers could be disrupted. 
 
 Although we utilize manufacturing facilities throughout the world, we have consolidated, and may further consolidate, our manufacturing operations to certain of our facilities to achieve efficiencies and gross margin improvements. Additionally, we typically consolidate the production of products from our acquisitions into our supply chain and manufacturing processes, which are technically complex and require expertise to operate. If we are unable to establish processes to efficiently and effectively produce high quality products in the consolidated locations, we may not achieve the anticipated synergies and production may be disrupted, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.

 Dependence on contract manufacturing and outsourcing other portions of our supply chain, including logistics and third-party package delivery services, may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and damage our reputation. Dependence on outsourced information technology and other administrative functions may impair our ability to operate effectively. 
 
 As part of our efforts to streamline operations and to manage costs, we outsource aspects of our manufacturing processes and other functions and continue to evaluate additional outsourcing. If our contract manufacturers or other outsourcers fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels, our ability to bring products to market and our reputation could suffer. For example, during a market upturn, our contract manufacturers may be unable to meet our demand requirements, which may preclude us from fulfilling our customers' orders on a timely basis. The ability of these manufacturers to perform is largely outside of our control. If one or more of the third-party package delivery or other logistics providers we use experiences a significant disruption in services or institutes a significant price increase, we may have to seek alternative providers, which could result in increased costs, and/or delay the delivery of our products. Additionally, changing or replacing our contract manufacturers, logistics providers or other outsourcers could cause disruptions or delays. In addition, we outsource significant portions of our information technology ("IT") and other administrative functions. Since IT is critical to our operations, any failure to perform on the part of our IT providers could impair our ability to operate effectively. In addition to the risks outlined above, problems with manufacturing or IT outsourcing could result in lower revenue and unexecuted efficiencies and impact our results of operations and our stock price. 
 
 If we suffer a loss to our factories, facilities or distribution system due to catastrophe, our operations could be seriously harmed. 
 
 Our factories, facilities and distribution system are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, terrorism, public health crises, increasing severity or frequency of extreme weather events, or other climate-change related risks, including resource scarcity, rationing or unexpected costs from increases in fuel and raw material prices that may be caused by extreme weather conditions. In addition, several of our facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquake due to their locations. Our production facilities, headquarters and laboratories in California, and our production facilities in Japan, are all located in areas with above-average seismic activity. In addition, our facilities in California are susceptible to extreme weather conditions such as drought, flooding and wildfires. If any of our facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility. If such a disruption were to occur, we could breach agreements, our reputation could be harmed, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected. In addition, because we have consolidated our manufacturing facilities and we may not have redundant manufacturing capability readily available, we are more likely to experience an interruption to our operations in the event of a catastrophe in any one location. Although we carry insurance for property damage and business interruption, these coverages are subject to deductibles as well as caps and may not be sufficient to cover the entirety of potential losses in certain catastrophic events. We do not carry insurance or financial reserves for interruptions or potential losses arising from earthquakes or terrorism. Also, our third-party insurance coverage will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on availability, cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention. Economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain third-party insurance. If our third-party insurance coverage is adversely affected or to the extent we have elected to self-insure, we may be at a greater risk that our financial condition will be harmed by a catastrophic loss. 
 
 If we experience a significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems, or if we fail to implement new systems and software successfully, our business could be adversely affected. 
 
 We rely on several centralized information technology systems throughout our company to provide products and services, keep financial records, process orders, manage inventory, process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions. Our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages, hardware failures, computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers, telecommunication failures, user errors, catastrophes or other unforeseen events. For example, in December 2020, it was widely reported that SolarWinds, an information technology company, was the subject of a cyberattack that created security vulnerabilities for thousands of its clients. We identified an impacted SolarWinds server and promptly took steps to contain and remediate the incidents. While we believe that there were no disruptions to our operations as a result of this attack, other similar attacks could have a significant negative impact on our systems and operations. Our information technology systems also may experience interruptions, delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with system integration, software upgrades or system migration work that takes place from time to time. If we were to experience a prolonged system disruption in the information technology systems that involve our interactions with customers or suppliers, it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, security breaches of our information technology systems or products could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our employees, 
 27 

Table of Contents 

 partners, customers or suppliers, which could result in our suffering significant financial or reputational damage. Concern over increasingly prevalent cyberattacks or other forms of security breaches of information technology systems can result in additional legal and regulatory requirements in the markets we operate our business and may lead to increased compliance burdens and costs to meet the regulatory obligations. For example, as a U.S. publicly traded company, we are subject to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Final Rule on Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance and Incident Disclosure which requires enhanced disclosure requirements for cybersecurity, with similar applicable requirements under the EU s NIS2 Directive and China s Data Security Law. 
 
 Financial and Tax Risks 
 
 Our retirement and post retirement pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our future results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 We have significant retirement and post retirement pension plan assets and obligations. The performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our plan expenses and funding obligations. Significant decreases in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets will increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 Changes in tax laws, unfavorable resolution of tax examinations, or exposure to additional tax liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 
 
 We are subject to taxes in the U.S., Singapore and various foreign jurisdictions. Governments in the jurisdictions in which we operate implement changes to tax laws and regulations periodically. Any implementation of tax laws that fundamentally change the taxation of corporations in the U.S. or Singapore could materially impact our effective tax rate and could have a significant adverse impact on our financial results. 
 
 The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development ("OECD") has introduced rules to establish a global minimum tax rate of 15 percent, commonly referred to as the Pillar Two rules. Many countries have enacted legislation to implement the Pillar Two rules. We are currently evaluating the potential impacts that Pillar Two may have on future periods and will continue to monitor the implementation of the Pillar Two rules in the jurisdictions in which we operate. 
 
 We are also subject to examinations of our tax returns by tax authorities in various jurisdictions around the world. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from ongoing tax examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. These assessments can require a high degree of judgment and estimation. Intercompany transactions associated with the sale of inventory, services, intellectual property and cost share arrangements are complex and affect our tax liabilities. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from ongoing tax examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. A difference in the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties from what is currently estimated could have an adverse effect on our financial results and condition. 
 
 If tax incentives change or cease to be in effect, our income taxes could increase significantly. 
 
 We benefit from tax incentives extended to our foreign subsidiaries to encourage investment or employment. Singapore has granted us tax incentives which require renewal at various times in the future. The incentives are conditioned on achieving various thresholds of investments and employment or specific types of income. Our taxes could increase if the incentives are not renewed upon expiration. If we cannot or do not wish to satisfy all or parts of the tax incentive conditions, we may lose the related tax incentive and could be required to refund tax incentives previously realized. As a result, our effective tax rate could be higher than it would have been had we maintained the benefits of the tax incentives. 
 
 We have outstanding debt and may incur other debt in the future, which could adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. 
 
 We are party to a 1.5 billion five-year unsecured credit facility that will expire on June 7, 2028. Furthermore, we are permitted pursuant to the credit agreement to establish an incremental revolving credit facility of up to 750 million. We also entered into an Uncommitted Money Market Line Credit agreement which provides for an aggregate borrowing capacity of 300 million. Under our U.S. commercial paper program, the company may issue and sell unsecured, short-term promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount not to exceed 1.5 billion with up to 397-day maturities. As of October 31, 2024, we had approximately 3.4 billion in outstanding indebtedness which included an aggregate outstanding principal amount of 3.3 billion in unsecured senior notes. We may borrow additional amounts in the future and use the proceeds from any future 
 28 

Table of Contents 

 borrowing for general corporate purposes, future acquisitions, expansion of our business or repurchases of our outstanding shares of common stock. 
 
 Our incurrence of this debt, and increases in our aggregate levels of debt, may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition by, among other things: 
 
 increasing our vulnerability to downturns in our business, to competitive pressures and to adverse economic and industry conditions; 
 requiring the dedication of an increased portion of our expected cash flows from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of expected cash flows available for other purposes, including capital expenditures, acquisitions, stock repurchases and dividends; and 
 limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry. 
 
 Our credit facility imposes restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to create liens on our assets and engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness, and requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. Our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control. In addition, the indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions. If we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders or noteholders, then, subject to applicable cure periods, our outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable. 
 
 We cannot assure that we will continue to pay dividends on our common stock. 
 
 Since the first quarter of fiscal year 2012, we have paid a quarterly dividend on our common stock. The timing, declaration, amount and payment of any future dividends fall within the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on many factors, including our available cash, estimated cash needs, earnings, financial condition, operating results, capital requirements, as well as limitations in our contractual agreements, applicable law, regulatory constraints, industry practice and other business considerations that our Board of Directors considers relevant. A change in our dividend program could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. 
 
 Adverse conditions in the global banking industry and credit markets may adversely impact the value of our cash investments or impair our liquidity. 
 
 As of October 31, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately 1,329 million invested or held in a mix of money market funds, time deposit accounts and bank demand deposit accounts. Disruptions and volatility in the financial markets may, in some cases, result in an inability to access assets such as money market funds that traditionally have been viewed as highly liquid or hinder our ability to borrow money in the amounts, at interest rates or upon the more favorable terms and conditions that might be available under different economic circumstances. Any failure of our counterparty financial institutions or funds in which we have invested may adversely impact our cash and cash equivalent positions and, in turn, our operating results and financial condition.

 Overview and Executive Summary 
 
 Agilent Technologies Inc. ("we", "Agilent" or the "company"), incorporated in Delaware in May 1999, is a global leader in life sciences, diagnostics and applied chemical markets, providing application focused solutions that include instruments, software, services and consumables for the entire laboratory workflow. 
 
 New Segment Structure 
 
 In the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, we announced a change in our operating segments to move our cell analysis business from our life sciences and applied markets segment to our diagnostics and genomics operating segment in order to further strengthen growth opportunities for both organizations. Following this reorganization, we continue to have three business segments comprised of life sciences and applied markets, diagnostics and genomics and Agilent CrossLab, each of which continues to comprise a reportable segment. We began reporting under this new structure with the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended January 31, 2024. All historical financial segment information has been recast to conform to this new presentation in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. There was no change to our Agilent CrossLab business segment. 
 
 Acquisition 
 
 On September 20, 2024, we acquired 100 percent of the stock of BIOVECTRA for total consideration of 915 million in cash. The acquisition expands our contract development and manufacturing organization. As a result of the acquisition, BIOVECTRA became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Agilent. The acquisition has been accounted for in accordance with the authoritative accounting guidance, and the results of BIOVECTRA are included in Agilent's consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. 
 
 Senior Notes 
 
 2027 Senior Notes. On September 9, 2024, we issued an aggregate principal amount of 600 million in senior notes ("2027 senior notes"). The 2027 senior notes were issued at 99.866 of their principal amount. The notes will mature on September 9, 2027, and bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.20 per annum. The interest is payable semi-annually on March 9th and September 9th of each year and payments will commence on March 9, 2025. 
 
 2034 Senior Notes. On September 9, 2024, we issued an aggregate principal amount of 600 million in senior notes ("2034 senior notes"). The 2034 senior notes were issued at 99.638 of their principal amount. The 2034 senior notes will mature on September 9, 2034, and bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.75 per annum. The interest is payable semi-annually on March 9th and September 9th of each year and payments will commence on March 9, 2025. 
 
 Actual Results 
 
 Agilent's net revenue of 6,510 million in 2024 decreased 5 percent when compared to 2023. Foreign currency movements for 2024 had no overall impact on revenue growth when compared to 2023. Net revenue declined in our life sciences and applied markets and diagnostics and genomics segments, mostly in the pharmaceutical market, due primarily to the overall pressures on our customers' capital expenditure spending which continued in 2024. Revenue declines were partially offset by revenue growth in our Agilent CrossLab segment. Revenue in the life sciences and applied markets business decreased 8 percent in 2024 when compared to 2023. Foreign currency movements had no overall impact on revenue growth in 2024 when compared to 2023. Revenue in the diagnostics and genomics business decreased 6 percent in 2024 when compared to 2023. Foreign currency movements had no overall impact on revenue growth in 2024 when compared to 2023. Revenue in the Agilent CrossLab business increased 5 percent in 2024 when compared to 2023. Foreign currency movements had no overall impact on revenue growth in 2024 when compared to 2023. 
 
 Agilent's net revenue of 6,833 million was slightly down in 2023 when compared to 2022. Foreign currency movements for 2023 had an overall unfavorable impact on revenue growth of 2 percentage points when compared to 2022. Net revenue declined in our life sciences and applied markets segment, in the pharmaceutical market and in the Asia Pacific region primarily related to weaker demand in China and an overall pressure on our customers' capital expenditures compared to 2022. The net revenue decline was partially offset by revenue growth from our other segments primarily in Agilent CrossLab. Revenue in the life sciences and applied markets business decreased 3 percent in 2023 when compared to 2022. Foreign currency movements had an overall unfavorable impact on revenue growth of 2 percentage points in 2023 when compared to 2022. Revenue in the diagnostics and genomics business decreased 1 percent in 2023 when compared to 2022. Foreign currency movements had an

 overall unfavorable impact on revenue growth of 2 percentage points in 2023 when compared to 2022. Revenue in the Agilent CrossLab business increased 8 percent in 2023 when compared to 2022. Foreign currency movements had an overall unfavorable impact on revenue growth of 2 percentage points in 2023 when compared to 2022. 
 
 Net income was 1,289 million in 2024 compared to net income of 1,240 million and 1,254 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively. Net income in 2024 was impacted by cost-saving initiatives and higher interest income. Net income in 2023 was impacted by the asset impairment charges primarily related to the exit of our Resolution Bioscience business and lower tax expense. Net income in 2022 was impacted by higher sales volume partially offset by supply chain, logistics and inflationary pressures increasing our costs. As of October 31, 2024 and 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents balances of 1,329 million and 1,590 million, respectively. 
 
 2021 Repurchase Program. During the year ended October 31, 2022, we repurchased and retired 8.4 million shares for 1,139 million under this authorization. During the year ended October 31, 2023, we repurchased and retired 661,739 shares for 99 million, excluding excise taxes, under this authorization. On March 1, 2023, the 2021 repurchase program was terminated and the remaining authorization of 339 million expired. 
 
 2023 Repurchase Program. On January 9, 2023, we announced that our board of directors had approved a share repurchase program (the "2023 repurchase program") designed, among other things, to reduce or eliminate dilution resulting from issuance of stock under the company's employee equity incentive programs. The 2023 repurchase program authorizes the purchase of up to 2.0 billion, excluding excise taxes, of our common stock at the company's discretion and has no fixed termination date. The 2023 repurchase program does not require the company to acquire a specific number of shares and may be suspended, amended or discontinued at any time. The 2023 repurchase program commenced on March 1, 2023, and also terminated and replaced the 2021 repurchase program. During the year ended October 31, 2023, we repurchased and retired 3.9 million shares for 476 million, excluding excise taxes, under this authorization. During the year ended October 31, 2024, we repurchased and retired 8.4 million shares for 1,150 million, excluding excise taxes, under this authorization. As of October 31, 2024, we had remaining authorization to repurchase up to approximately 374 million of our common stock under the 2023 repurchase program. 
 
 On May 29, 2024, we announced that our board of directors had approved a new share repurchase program (the "2024 repurchase program") designed, among other things, to reduce or eliminate dilution resulting from issuance of stock under the company's employee equity incentive programs. The 2024 repurchase program authorizes the purchase of up to 2.0 billion, excluding excise taxes, of our common stock at the company's discretion and has no fixed termination date. The 2024 repurchase program does not require the company to acquire a specific number of shares and may be suspended, amended or discontinued at any time. The 2024 repurchase program became effective on August 1, 2024 and will commence upon the termination of our 2023 repurchase program. 
 
 The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which was enacted into law on August 16, 2022, imposed a nondeductible 1 excise tax on the net value of certain stock repurchases made after December 31, 2022. During the year ended October 31, 2024, we recorded the applicable excise taxes payable of approximately 10 million as an incremental cost of the shares repurchased and a corresponding liability for the excise tax payable in other accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. In fiscal year 2023, we recorded excise taxes payable of approximately 3 million related to shares repurchased in 2023 and paid the tax in 2024. 
 
 Dividends. During the year ended October 31, 2024, cash dividends of 0.944 per share, or 274 million were declared and paid on the company's outstanding common stock. During the year ended October 31, 2023, cash dividends of 0.900 per share, or 265 million were declared and paid on the company's outstanding common stock. During the year ended October 31, 2022, cash dividends of 0.840 per share, or 250 million were declared and paid on the company's outstanding common stock. 
 
 On November 20, 2024, we declared a quarterly dividend of 0.248 per share of common stock, or approximately 71 million which will be paid on January 22, 2025, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 31, 2024. The timing and amounts of any future dividends are subject to determination and approval by our board of directors. 
 
 Looking forward, our primary focus remains on enhancing our customers experience, delivering differentiated product solutions and driving productivity improvements. While customer capital budgets continue to be constrained, we anticipate a gradual and steady recovery in the short-term. We also remain optimistic about the long-term health of our key end markets. Although inflationary pressures are uncertain, we will continue to mitigate their impact through targeted pricing strategies and various other cost-saving initiatives.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable. Although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future, actual results may be different from the estimates. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially change the financial statements. Our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult, subjective or complex judgments by management. Those policies are revenue recognition, inventory valuation, retirement and post-retirement plan assumptions, valuation of goodwill and purchased intangible assets, restructuring and accounting for income taxes. 
 
 Revenue Recognition . We enter into contracts to sell products, services or combinations of products and services. Products may include hardware or software and services may include one-time service events or services performed over time. 
 
 We derive revenue primarily from the sale of analytical and diagnostics products and services. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct product or service to a customer and is the unit of account under Accounting Standard Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, ASC 606 ). Revenue is recognized when control of the promised products or services is transferred to our customers and the performance obligation is fulfilled in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to be entitled in exchange for those products or services, the transaction price. For equipment, consumables, and most software licenses, control transfers to the customer at a point in time. We use present right to payment, legal title, physical possession of the asset, and risks and rewards of ownership as indicators to determine the transfer of control to the customer. For products that transfer control over time, revenue is recognized as the performance obligation is satisfied. Product over time revenue is assessed against the following criteria: the performance creates an asset that the customer controls as the asset is created; the asset has no alternative use; and we have an enforceable right to payment. Where acceptance is not a formality, the customer must have documented their acceptance of the product or service. For products that include installation, if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate performance obligation, product revenue is recognized when control has passed to the customer, and recognition of installation revenue occurs once completed. Product revenue, including sales to resellers and distributors is reduced for provisions for warranties, returns, and other adjustments in the period the related sales are recorded. 
 
 Service revenue includes extended warranty, customer and software support including: Software as a Service, post contract support, consulting including companion diagnostics, and training and education. Instrument service contracts and software maintenance contracts are typically annual contracts, which are billed at the beginning of the contract or maintenance period. Revenue for these contracts is recognized on a straight-line basis to revenue over the service period, as a time-based measure of progress best reflects our performance in satisfying this obligation. There are no deferred costs associated with the service contract, as the cost of the service is recorded when the service is performed. Service calls not included in a support contract are recognized to revenue at the time a service is performed. 
 
 We have sales from standalone software. These arrangements typically include software licenses and maintenance contracts, both of which we have determined are distinct performance obligations. We determine the amount of the transaction price to allocate to the license and maintenance contract based on the relative standalone selling price of each performance obligation. Software license revenue is recognized at the point in time when control has been transferred to the customer. The revenue allocated to the software maintenance contract is recognized on a straight-line basis over the maintenance period, which is the contractual term of the contract, as a time-based measure of progress best reflects our performance in satisfying this obligation. Unspecified rights to software upgrades are typically sold as part of the maintenance contract on a when-and-if-available basis. 
 
 Our multiple-element arrangements are generally comprised of a combination of instruments, installation or other start-up services, and/or software, and/or support or services. Hardware and software elements are typically delivered at the same time and revenue is recognized when control passes to the customer. Service revenue is deferred and recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer. Our arrangements generally do not include any provisions for cancellation, termination, or refunds that would significantly impact recognized revenue. 
 
 For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the consideration to which we expect to be entitled to each performance obligation based on relative standalone selling prices and recognize the related revenue when or as control of each individual performance obligation is transferred to customers. We estimate the standalone selling price by calculating the 
 35 

Table of Contents 

 average historical selling price of our products and services per geographic region for each performance obligation. Stand-alone selling prices are determined for each distinct good or service in the contract, and then we allocate the transaction price in proportion to those standalone selling prices by performance obligations. 
 
 A portion of our revenue relates to lease arrangements. Standalone lease arrangements are outside the scope of ASC 606 and are therefore accounted for in accordance with ASC 842, Leases ("ASC 842"). Each of these contracts is evaluated as a lease arrangement, either as an operating lease or a sales-type finance lease using the current lease classification guidance. In a lease arrangement that is a multiple-element arrangement, the revenue associated with the lease component is treated under the lease accounting standard ASC 842, whereas the revenue associated with the non-lease component is recognized in accordance with the ASC 606 revenue standard. 
 
 Inventory Valuation. Inventory is valued at standard cost, which approximates actual cost computed on a first-in, first-out basis, not in excess of market value. We assess the valuation of our inventory on a periodic basis and make adjustments to the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon estimates and assumptions about future demand, economic conditions and actual usage, which require management judgment. Such estimates are difficult to make under most economic conditions. The excess balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess inventory charge. Our excess inventory review process includes analysis of inventory levels, sales trends and forecasts, managing product rollovers and working with manufacturing to maximize recovery of excess inventory and to estimate and record reserves for excess, slow-moving and obsolete inventory. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional write-downs may be required. If actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated, inventory previously written down may be sold to customers, resulting in lower cost of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period. 
 
 Retirement and Post-Retirement Benefit Plan Assumptions. Retirement and post-retirement benefit plan costs are a significant cost of doing business. They represent obligations that will ultimately be settled sometime in the future and therefore are subject to estimation. Pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employees' average expected future service to Agilent based on the terms of the plans and investment and funding decisions. To estimate the impact of these future payments and our decisions concerning funding of these obligations, we are required to make assumptions using actuarial concepts within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. Two critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long-term return on plan assets. Other important assumptions include expected future salary increases, expected future increases to benefit payments, expected retirement dates, employee turnover, retiree mortality rates, and portfolio composition. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually. 
 
 The discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit payments at the measurement date - October 31 for both U.S. and non-U.S. plans. For 2024 and 2023, the U.S. discount rates were based on the results of matching expected plan benefit payments with cash flows from a hypothetically constructed bond portfolio. In 2024, discount rates for the U.S. defined benefit plans and post-retirement benefit plans decreased compared to the previous year due to the decrease in the corporate bond rates. For 2024 and 2023, the discount rates for non-U.S. defined benefit plans were generally based on published rates for high quality corporate bonds and in 2024, mostly decreased compared to the previous year. If we had changed our discount rate by 1 percent, the impact would have been approximately 1 million on U.S. defined benefit plans and post-retirement benefit plans expense and 11 million on non-U.S. defined benefit plans expense for the year ended October 31, 2024. Lower discount rates usually increase present values of the pension benefit obligation and subsequent year pension expense; higher discount rates usually decrease present values of the pension benefit obligation and subsequent year pension expense. 
 
 The company uses alternate methods of amortization as allowed by the authoritative guidance which amortizes the actuarial gains and losses on a consistent basis for the years presented. For U.S. defined benefit plans, gains and losses are amortized over the average future lifetime of participants using the corridor method. For most non-U.S. defined benefit plans and U.S. post-retirement benefit plans, gains and losses are amortized over the average remaining future service period or remaining lifetime of participants depending upon the plan, using a separate layer for each year's gains and losses. 
 
 In the U.S., target asset allocations for our retirement and post-retirement benefit plans were approximately 50 percent to equities and approximately 50 percent to fixed income investments as of October 31, 2024. Our Deferred Profit-Sharing Plan target asset allocation is approximately 60 percent to equities and approximately 40 percent to fixed income investments. Approximately 1 percent of the retirement and post-retirement plans consists of limited partnerships. Outside the U.S., our target asset allocation (excluding annuity contracts in the U.K.) ranges from zero percent to 60 percent to equities, from 38 percent to 100 percent to fixed income investments, and from zero to 25 percent to real estate, depending on the plan. All plans' assets are broadly diversified. Due to fluctuations in equity and bond markets, our actual allocations of plan assets at October 31, 2024, may differ from the target allocation. Our policy is to bring the actual allocation in line with the target allocation. 
 36 

Table of Contents 

Equity securities include exchange-traded common stock and preferred stock of companies from broadly diversified industries. Fixed income securities include a global portfolio of corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries, government securities, mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, derivative instruments and other. The annuity contracts are insurance buy-in contracts issued by a third-party insurance company to cover the benefit obligations of all participants under the U.K. defined benefit plan and are funded with existing pension plan assets with no adjustment made to the benefit obligations. Real estate securities include holdings of managed investment funds which invest primarily in the equity instruments of real estate investment trusts and other similar real estate investments. Other investments include a group trust consisting primarily of private equity partnerships. 
 
 The expected long-term return on plan assets is estimated using current and expected asset allocations as well as historical and expected returns. Plan assets are valued at fair value. If we had changed our estimated return on assets by 1 percent, the impact would have been 4 million on U.S. defined benefit plans and post-retirement benefit plans expense and 8 million on non-U.S. defined benefit plans expense for the year ended October 31, 2024. The total net periodic pension and post-retirement benefit costs recorded were a 9 million benefit in 2024, 6 million expense in 2023 and 2 million benefit in 2022. These costs included a loss on settlement of 2 million, 4 million and 4 million, for the years ended October 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
 
 Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets. We assess our goodwill and purchased intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Under the authoritative guidance, we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. The accounting standard gives an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether performing the quantitative test is necessary. If an entity believes, as a result of its qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not (i.e., greater than 50 chance) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test will be required. Otherwise, no further testing will be required. 
 
 The guidance includes examples of events and circumstances that might indicate that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount. These include macro-economic conditions such as deterioration in the entity's operating environment or industry or market considerations; entity-specific events such as increasing costs, declining financial performance, or loss of key personnel; or other events such as an expectation that a reporting unit will be sold or a sustained decrease in the stock price on either an absolute basis or relative to peers. 
 
 If it is determined, as a result of the qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then we are required to perform a quantitative impairment test on goodwill to identify and measure the amount of a goodwill impairment loss to be recognized. A goodwill impairment loss, if any, is measured as the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying value, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. As defined in the authoritative guidance, a reporting unit is an operating segment, or one level below an operating segment. We aggregate components of an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics into our reporting units. 
 
 At the beginning of fiscal year 2024, in connection with the change in our segment reporting, we assessed goodwill impairment for our three reporting units which consisted of our three segments: life sciences and applied markets, diagnostics and genomics and Agilent CrossLab. We performed a quantitative test for goodwill impairment of the three reporting units as of November 1, 2023, due to the change in our segment structure. As of November 1, 2023, there was no impairment of goodwill. 
 
 In fiscal year 2024, we again assessed goodwill impairment for our three reporting units which consisted of our three segments: life sciences and applied markets, diagnostics and genomics and Agilent CrossLab. We performed a qualitative test for goodwill impairment of the three reporting units as of September 30, 2024, our annual impairment test date. Based on the results of our qualitative testing, there was no impairment of goodwill as of September 30, 2024. Each quarter we review the events and circumstances to determine if goodwill impairment is indicated. There was no impairment of goodwill during the years ended October 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. 
 
 Purchased intangible assets consist primarily of acquired developed technologies, proprietary know-how, trademarks, and customer relationships and are amortized using the best estimate of the asset's useful life that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits are consumed or used up or a straight-line method ranging from 6 months to 15 years. Our determination of the fair value of the intangible assets acquired involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Specifically, our determination of the fair value of the developed product technology and in-process research and development ("IPR D") acquired involves significant estimates and assumptions related to revenue growth rates and discount rates. Our determination of the fair value of customer relationships acquired involves significant estimates and assumptions related to revenue growth rates, discount rates, and customer attrition rates. Our determination of the fair value of the trade name acquired involves the 
 37 

Table of Contents 

 use of significant estimates and assumptions related to revenue growth rates, royalty rates and discount rates. We value backlog using the discounted cash flows based on the estimated revenue from pending orders. We value license agreements based on the expected future cash receipts from license agreements, discounted to present value over the term of the agreement. We believe that the fair value assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on reasonable assumptions and estimates that marketplace participants would use. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. IPR D is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter. When the IPR D project is complete, it is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and is amortized over its estimated useful life. If an IPR D project is abandoned, we will record a charge for the value of the related intangible asset to our consolidated statement of operations in the period it is abandoned. 
 
 We continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of finite-lived intangible assets may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances occur, we assess the recoverability of finite-lived intangible assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets. 
 
 Our indefinite-lived intangible assets are IPR D intangible assets. The accounting guidance allows a qualitative approach for testing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, similar to the issued impairment testing guidance for goodwill and allows the option to first assess qualitative factors (events and circumstances) that could have affected the significant inputs used in determining the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not (i.e., greater than 50 chance) that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. An organization may choose to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinite-lived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to calculating its fair value. As of October 31, 2024, we do not have any indefinite-lived intangible assets. 
 
 During fiscal year 2024, we recorded an impairment of in-process research and development of 6 million in research and development in the consolidated statement of operations related to a project in our life sciences and applied markets segment. There were no impairments of indefinite-lived intangible assets during fiscal years 2023 and 2022. 
 
 Restructuring. The main components of our restructuring plan are related to workforce reductions, consolidation of excess leased facilities and site closures. Workforce reduction charges are accrued when payment of benefits becomes probable that the employees are entitled to the severance and the amounts can be estimated. Consolidation of facilities costs primarily consists of accelerated depreciation of right-of-use assets classified as held and used. In accordance with the accounting guidance, it was determined that certain assets had been abandoned, and an assessment was made of the remaining useful lives and potential alternative uses. If the amounts and timing of cash flows from restructuring activities are significantly different from what we have estimated, the actual amounts of restructuring and other related charges could be materially different, either higher or lower, than those we have recorded. See Note 16. "Restructuring and Other Related Costs" to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
 
 Accounting for Income Taxes. We must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period. On a quarterly basis, we provide for income taxes based upon an estimated annual effective tax rate. The effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings, tax regulations governing each region, availability of tax credits and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies. We monitor the changes in many factors and adjust our effective income tax rate on a timely basis. If actual results differ from these estimates, this could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Significant management judgment is also required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part. When it is more-likely-than-not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets may not be realized, a valuation allowance must be established against such deferred tax assets. We consider all available positive and negative evidence on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis when assessing whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable. We consider evidence such as our past operating results, the existence of losses in recent years and our forecast of future taxable income. 
 
 The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. Although the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model, the determination of whether an uncertain tax position has met those thresholds will continue to require significant judgment by management. In accordance with the guidance on the accounting for 
 38 

Table of Contents 

 uncertainty in income taxes, for all U.S. and other tax jurisdictions, we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and interest will be due. The ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties may differ from what is currently estimated, which could result in a material impact on income tax expense. If our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would be required. If events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. We include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of operations.

Restructuring and Other Related Costs 
 
 Summary of Restructuring Plans. In fiscal years 2024 and 2023, we announced restructuring plans that were both designed to reduce costs and expenses in response to macroeconomic conditions. These actions impact all three of our business segments. The costs associated with these restructuring plans were not allocated to our business segments' results; however, each business segment will benefit from the future cost savings from these actions. When completed, the restructuring programs are expected to result in the reduction in annual cost of sales and operating expenses over the three business segments. 
 
 A summary of our aggregate liability related to both restructuring plans and the total restructuring expense since inception of those plans are shown in the table below:

 Non-cash settlements include accelerated share-based compensation expense related to workforce reductions and accelerated depreciation expense of right-of-use and machinery and equipment assets related to the consolidation of excess facilities. The aggregate restructuring liability of million at October 31, 2024, was recorded in other accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet and reflects estimated future cash outlays.

 Fiscal Year 2024 Plan ("FY24 Plan") 
 
 In the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, we initiated a new restructuring plan designed to further reduce costs and expenses in response to current macroeconomic conditions. The plan includes a reduction of our total headcount by approximately regular employees, representing approximately percent of our global workforce. 
 
 In connection with the FY24 Plan, we have recorded restructuring expenses of million in fiscal year 2024. The costs associated with this workforce reduction include severance, accelerated share-based compensation expense and other personnel-related costs. The timing and scope of the workforce reductions will vary based on local legal requirements. While the majority of the workforce reduction was completed in fiscal year 2024, we expect to substantially complete the remaining restructuring activities by the end of the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. When completed, the restructuring program is expected to result in the reduction of approximately 100 million in annual cost of sales and operating expenses over our three business segments. 
 
 A summary of the FY24 Plan activity is shown in the table below: 
 
 Workforce Reduction (in millions) Balance at October 31, 2023 Income statement expense Non-cash settlements ) Cash payments ) Balance at October 31, 2024 Total restructuring expense since inception of FY24 Plan 
 
 Non-cash settlements include accelerated share-based compensation expense related to workforce reductions. 
 
 Fiscal Year 2023 Plan ("FY23 Plan") 
 
 In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023, we initiated the restructuring plan designed to reduce costs and expenses in response to the macroeconomic conditions. The plan included a reduction of our total headcount by approximately regular employees, representing approximately percent of our global workforce, and the consolidation of our excess facilities, including some site closures. 
 
 In connection with the FY23 Plan, we recorded restructuring expenses of million in 2024 and million, in 2023. The restructuring plan expenses include severance, accelerated share-based compensation expense and other personnel costs associated with the workforce reduction. The consolidation of excess facilities includes accelerated depreciation expenses of right-of-use and machinery and equipment assets, and other facilities-related costs. The timing and scope of the workforce reductions will vary based on local legal requirements. While the majority of the workforce reduction was completed in 2024, we expect to substantially complete the remaining restructuring activities by the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2025. When completed, the restructuring program is expected to result in the reduction of approximately 80 million in annual cost of sales and operating expenses over our three business segments.

Foreign Currency 
 
 Our revenues, costs and expenses, and monetary assets and liabilities and equity are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our global operating and financing activities. Foreign currency movements had no overall impact on revenue growth in the year ended October 31, 2024 when compared to the same period last year. Foreign currency movements for the year ended October 31, 2023, had an overall unfavorable impact on revenue of 2 percentage points when compared to 2022. When movements in foreign currency exchange rates have a negative impact on revenue, they will also have a positive impact by reducing our costs and expenses. We calculate the impact of movements in foreign currency exchange rates by applying the actual foreign currency exchange rates in effect during the last month of each quarter of the current year to both the applicable current and prior year periods. We hedge revenues, expenses and balance sheet exposures that are not denominated in the functional currencies of our subsidiaries on a short term and anticipated basis. We do experience some fluctuations within individual lines of the consolidated statement of operations and balance sheet because our hedging program is not designed to offset the currency movements in each category of revenues, expenses, monetary assets and liabilities. Our hedging program is designed to hedge currency movements on a relatively short-term basis (up to a rolling twelve-month period). We may also hedge equity balances denominated in foreign currency on a long-term basis. To the extent that we are required to pay for all, or portions, of an acquisition price in foreign currencies, we may enter into foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk that currency movements will impact the U.S. dollar cost of the transaction.

 Agilent's net revenue of 6,510 million for the year ended October 31, 2024, decreased 5 percent when compared to 2023. Foreign currency movements had no overall impact on revenue growth in 2024 when compared to 2023. For the year ended October 31, 2024, net revenue declined in our life sciences and applied markets and diagnostics and genomics segments, mostly in the pharmaceutical market, due primarily to the overall pressures on our customers' capital expenditure spending which continued in 2024. Revenue declines were partially offset by revenue growth in our Agilent CrossLab segment. Agilent's net revenue of 6,833 million was slightly down in 2023 when compared to 2022. Foreign currency movements had an overall unfavorable impact on revenue growth of 2 percentage points in 2023 when compared to 2022. For the year ended October 31, 2023, net revenue declined in our life sciences and applied markets segment in the pharmaceutical market and in the Asia Pacific region primarily related to weaker demand in China and an overall pressure on our customers' capital expenditures compared to the same period last year. The net revenue decline was partially offset by revenue growth from our other segments primarily in Agilent CrossLab. 
 
 Product revenue includes revenue generated from the sales of our analytical instrumentation, software and consumables. Revenue from products decreased 7 percent for the year ended October 31, 2024, when compared to 2023. The product revenue decline was primarily driven by decreases in our liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry, cell analysis and nucleic acid solutions businesses partially offset by increases in our consumables and pathology businesses when compared to 2023.

The tax holiday in Singapore was renegotiated and extended through 2030. As a result of the incentive, the impact of the tax holiday decreased income taxes by 84 million, 54 million, and 53 million in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. The benefit of the tax holiday on net income per share (diluted) was approximately 0.29, 0.18, and 0.18 in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
 
 With these jurisdictions and the U.S., it is reasonably possible that some tax audits may be completed over the next twelve months. However, management is not able to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of any other future tax payments or change in unrecognized tax benefits, if any. 
 
 The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. Although the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model, the determination of whether an uncertain tax position has met those thresholds will continue to require significant judgment by management. In accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, for all U.S. and other tax jurisdictions, we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and interest will be due. The ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties may differ from what is currently estimated, which could result in a material impact on income tax expense. If our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would be required. If events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. We include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of operations.

Financial Condition 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 We believe our cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from operations, and ability to access capital markets and credit lines will satisfy, for at least the next twelve months and beyond, our liquidity requirements, both globally and domestically, including the following: working capital needs, capital expenditures, business acquisitions, stock repurchases, cash dividends, contractual obligations, commitments, principal and interest payments on debt, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations. 
 
 Our financial position as of October 31, 2024 consisted of cash and cash equivalents of 1,329 million as compared to 1,590 million as of October 31, 2023. 
 
 We may, from time to time, retire certain outstanding debt of ours through open market cash purchases, privately-negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such transactions, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. 
 
 Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities 
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 1,751 million in 2024 compared to net cash provided of 1,772 million in 2023 and net cash provided of 1,312 million in 2022. Net cash paid for income taxes was approximately 314 million in 2024 compared to income taxes paid of 199 million in 2023 and 279 million, in 2022. For the years ended October 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, other assets and liabilities used cash of 49 million, provided cash of 47 million and used cash of 8 million, respectively. 
 
 In 2024, accounts receivable provided cash of 7 million, compared to cash provided of 132 million in 2023, and cash used of 321 million in 2022. Days' sales outstanding as of October 31, were 70 days in 2024, 69 days in 2023 and 68 days in 2022. In 2024, the decrease in cash provided by accounts receivable was primarily due to lower collectible sales compared to 2023. In 2023 cash provided in accounts receivable was driven by stronger collections compared to 2022. The change in accounts payable provided cash of 103 million in 2024, used cash of 171 million in 2023 and provided cash of 121 million in 2022. In 2024 the change was mainly due to less expenditures for direct materials as we continued optimizing our inventory levels and to timing of payments. Cash provided by inventory was 34 million in 2024 compared to cash used of 33 million in 2023 and cash used of 248 million in 2022. Inventory days on-hand decreased to 111 days in 2024 compared to 120 days in 2023 and 112 days in 2022. 
 
 The employee compensation and benefits liability used cash of 12 million in 2024 compared to cash used of 91 million in 2023 and cash used of 22 million in 2022. In 2024, the change was largely due to a decrease in variable and incentive pay compared to 2023. In 2023, the change was largely due to a lower accrual for variable pay compared to 2022. We paid approximately 105 million in 2024 under our variable and incentive pay programs compared to 185 million in 2023 and 201 million in 2022. 
 
 We made no contributions to our U.S defined benefit plans in 2024, 2023 and 2022. We contributed 20 million in 2024 and 21 million in 2023 and 17 million in 2022 to our non-U.S. defined benefit plans, respectively. We did not contribute to our U.S. post-retirement benefit plans in 2024, 2023 and 2022. Our non-U.S. defined benefit plans are generally funded ratably throughout the year. Our annual contributions are highly dependent on the relative performance of our assets versus our projected liabilities, among other factors. We do not expect to contribute to our U.S. plans and U.S. post-retirement benefit plans during 2025. We expect to contribute 19 million to our non-U.S. defined benefit plans during 2025. 
 
 Net Cash Used in Investing Activities 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 1,258 million in 2024 compared to net cash used of 310 million in 2023 and net cash used of 338 million in 2022. 
 
 Investments in property, plant and equipment were 378 million in 2024, 298 million in 2023 and 291 million in 2022. Our anticipated capital expenditures for fiscal year 2025 will be approximately 450 million. These continued investments in property plant and equipment are primarily due to the planned expansion of our manufacturing capacity for production of nucleic acid based therapeutics in Frederick, Colorado. Some of our investment may be eligible to qualify for reimbursement incentives, which will not fully be known until the expansion is substantially complete. 
 
 52 

In 2024, we invested 862 million primarily for our acquisition of BIOVECTRA and one other acquisition compared to 51 million for two acquisitions in 2023 and 52 million for our acquisition of Polymer Standards Service and advanced artificial intelligence technology in 2022. In 2023, proceeds from the divestiture of our Resolution Bioscience business were 50 million. 
 
 Net Cash Used in Financing Activities 
 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 752 million in 2024 compared to net cash used of 930 million in 2023 and net cash used of 1,372 million in 2022. Net cash from financing activities consisted primarily of cash flows associated with the issuances and repurchases of common stock, payments of cash dividends, borrowings and repayments under credit facilities and commercial paper, issuances and repayments of long term debt and payments of contingent consideration. 
 
 Treasury Stock Repurchases. In 2024, we repurchased and retired 8.4 million shares for 1,150 million, excluding excise tax liability of approximately 10 million compared to repurchases in 2023 of 4.6 million shares for 575 million, excluding excise tax liability of approximately 3 million which was paid in 2024 and 8.4 million shares for 1,139 million, in 2022. 
 
 The activity of our repurchases and remaining authorization by repurchase program follows: 
 
 2024 2023 2022 Remaining Shares Cost Shares Cost Shares Cost Authorization Repurchase Program (in millions) 2021 Repurchase program 0.7 99 8.4 1,139 2023 Repurchase program 8.4 1,150 3.9 476 374 2024 Repurchase program 2,000 Total 8.4 1,150 4.6 575 8.4 1,139 
 
 The 2024 repurchase program authorizes the purchase of up to 2.0 billion, excluding excise taxes, of our common stock at the company's discretion and has no fixed termination date. The 2024 repurchase program does not require the company to acquire a specific number of shares and may be suspended, amended or discontinued at any time. The 2024 repurchase program became effective on August 1, 2024 and will commence upon the termination of our 2023 repurchase program. 
 
 Dividends. For the years ended October 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, cash dividends of 274 million, 265 million and 250 million were paid on the company's outstanding common stock, respectively. 
 
 On November 20, 2024, we declared a quarterly dividend of 0.248 per share of common stock, or approximately 71 million which will be paid on January 22, 2025 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 31, 2024. The timing and amounts of any future dividends are subject to determination and approval by our board of directors. 
 
 Short-term Debt 
 
 Credit Facilities. On June 7, 2023, we entered into a new credit agreement with a group of financial institutions which provides for a 1.5 billion five-year unsecured credit facility that will expire on June 7, 2028, and an incremental revolving credit facility in an aggregate amount of up to 750 million. During 2024, we made no borrowings or repayments under these credit facilities compared to 360 million borrowed and repaid in 2023 and no borrowings or repayments in 2022. 
 
 On June 2, 2023, we entered into an Uncommitted Money Market Line Credit agreement with Societe Generale which provides for an aggregate borrowing capacity of 300 million. The credit facility is an uncommitted short-term cash advance facility where each request must be at least 1 million. The interest rate is set by the lender at the time of the borrowing and is fixed for the duration of the advance. During 2024, we borrowed and repaid 215 million under this credit facility compared to 61 million borrowed and repaid in 2023. As of October 31, 2024, we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility. 
 
 We were in compliance with the covenants for the credit facilities during the year ended October 31, 2024. 
 53 

Commercial Paper. Under our U.S. commercial paper program, we may issue and sell unsecured, short-term promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount not to exceed 1.5 billion with up to 397-day maturities. At any point in time, the company intends to maintain available commitments under its revolving credit facility in an amount at least equal to the amount of the commercial paper notes outstanding. Amounts available under the program may be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed from time to time. The proceeds from issuances under the program may be used for general corporate purposes. During 2024, we borrowed 1.19 billion and repaid 1.15 billion compared to 1.67 billion borrowed and 1.70 billion repaid in 2023, and 1.29 billion borrowed and 1.26 billion repaid in 2022. As of October 31, 2024, we had 40 million borrowings outstanding under our U.S. commercial paper program and had a weighted average annual interest rate of 4.92 percent. 
 
 Other Loans . In September 2024, we completed the BIOVECTRA acquisition and assumed two interest-free loans from the Strategic Innovation Fund ("SIF") in the amount of 20 million with 2 million recorded at fair value in short-term debt. The loans are repayable in quarterly and yearly installments at a weighted average imputed interest rate of 4.7 percent. In addition, we assumed two interest-free loans with the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency ACOA in the amount of 4 million with 3 million recorded at fair value in short-term debt. The loans are repayable in monthly installments at a weighted average imputed interest rate of 4.5 percent. 
 
 Long-term Debt 
 
 In 2024, proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of 1,197 million related to the issuance of our 2027 and 2034 senior notes. Repayments of long-term debt of 600 million related to the full payment of the outstanding principal amount of our term loan. In 2022, we used the proceeds of 600 million from the term loan facility and repaid the 600 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 3.875 2023 senior notes. The total redemption price of approximately 609 million was computed in accordance with the terms of the 2023 senior notes as the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and unpaid interest on the notes being redeemed. In addition, 7 million of accrued interest, up to but not including the applicable redemption date, was paid. 
 
 Term Loan Facility. On April 15, 2022, we entered into a term loan agreement with a group of financial institutions, which provided for a 600 million delayed draw term loan that will mature on April 15, 2025. Loans under the term loan agreement bear interest, at our option, either at: (i) the alternate base rate, as defined in the term loan agreement, plus the applicable margin for such loans or (ii) adjusted term SOFR, as defined in the term loan agreement, plus the applicable margin for such loans. As of October 31, 2024, the term loan facility was terminated. 
 
 Other Loans. In September 2024, we completed the BIOVECTRA acquisition and assumed two interest-free loans from the Strategic Innovation Fund ("SIF") in the amount of 20 million with 18 million recorded at fair value in long-term debt. The loans are repayable in quarterly and yearly installments through 2040 at a weighted average imputed interest rate of 4.7 percent.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Other 
 
 Our liquidity is affected by many factors, some of which are based on normal ongoing operations of our business and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global economics and markets. Our cash balances are generated and held in many locations throughout the world. Local government regulations may restrict our ability to move cash balances to meet cash needs under certain circumstances. We do not currently expect such regulations and restrictions to impact our ability to pay vendors and conduct operations throughout our global organization. 
 
 Contractual Commitments 
 
 Our cash flows from operations are dependent on a number of factors, including fluctuations in our operating results, accounts receivable collections, inventory management, and the timing of tax and other payments. As a result, the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with such factors. 
 
 The following table summarizes our total contractual obligations at October 31, 2024, for Agilent operations and excludes amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheet (in millions): 
 
 Less than one year One to three years Three to five years More than five years Commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers 601 40 Other purchase commitments 128 8 Total 729 48 
 
 Commitments to Contract Manufacturers and Suppliers. We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, we issue purchase orders with estimates of our requirements several months ahead of the delivery dates. The above amounts represent the commitments under the open purchase orders with our suppliers that have not yet been received. However, our agreements with these suppliers usually provide us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed. We expect to fulfill most of our purchase commitments for inventory within one year. 
 
 Other Purchase Commitments. We have categorized "other purchase commitments" related to contracts with professional services suppliers. Typically, we can cancel contracts with professional services suppliers without penalties. For those contracts that are not cancelable without penalties, there are termination fees and costs or commitments for continued spending that we are obligated to pay to a supplier under each contact's termination period before such contract can be cancelled. Our contractual obligations with these suppliers under "other purchase commitments" were approximately 136 million. 
 
 We had no material off-balance sheet arrangements as of October 31, 2024, or October 31, 2023. 
 
 On Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 The following table summarizes our total contractual obligations on our October 31, 2024 balance sheet (in millions):

 Other long-term liabilities as of October 31, 2024 and October 31, 2023 include 115 million and 162 million, respectively, related to long-term income tax liabilities. Of these amounts, 64 million and 68 million related to uncertain tax positions as of October 31, 2024 and October 31, 2023, respectively. We are unable to accurately predict when these amounts 
 55 

will be realized or released. However, it is reasonably possible that there could be significant changes to our unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months due to either the expiration of a statute of limitations or a tax audit settlement. As of October 31, 2024, the remaining 51 million included in other long-term liabilities relates to the U.S. transition tax payment which is due within the next two years. 

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our sales commitments, anticipated sales, and assets and liabilities and equity denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries. We hedge future cash flows denominated in currencies other than the functional currency using sales forecasts up to twelve months in advance. Our exposure to exchange rate risks is mainly managed on an enterprise-wide basis. This strategy utilizes derivative financial instruments, including option and forward contracts, to hedge certain foreign currency exposures with the intent of offsetting gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and losses on the derivative contracts hedging them. We may also hedge equity balances denominated in foreign currency on a long-term basis. We do not currently and do not intend to utilize derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes. To the extent that we are required to pay for all, or portions, of an acquisition price in foreign currencies, we may enter into foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk that currency movements will impact the cost of the transaction. 
 
 Our operations generate non-functional currency cash flows such as revenues, third party vendor payments and inter-company payments. In anticipation of these foreign currency cash flows and in view of volatility of the currency market, we enter into such foreign exchange contracts as are described above to manage our currency risk. Approximately 48 percent of our revenue in 2024, 52 percent of our revenue in 2023 and 56 percent of our revenue in 2022 was generated in U.S. dollars. Foreign currency movements had no overall impact on revenue growth in the year ended October 31, 2024. We calculate the impact of movements in foreign currency exchange rates by applying the actual foreign currency exchange rates in effect during the last month of each quarter of the current year to both the applicable current and prior year periods. 
 
 We performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above. As of October 31, 2024 and 2023, the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, statement of comprehensive income or cash flows. 
 
 We are also exposed to interest rate risk due to the mismatch between the interest expense we pay on our loans at fixed rates and the variable rates of interest we receive from cash, cash equivalents and other short-term investments. We have issued long-term debt in U.S. dollars or foreign currencies at fixed interest rates based on the market conditions at the time of financing. We believe that the fair value of our fixed rate debt changes when the underlying market rates of interest change, and we may use interest rate swaps to modify such market risk. 
 
 We performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in interest rates relating to the underlying fair value of our fixed rate debt. As of October 31, 2024 and 2023, the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in interest rates would result in an immaterial impact to the fair value of our fixed interest rate debt.

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Agilent Technologies, Inc. 
 
 Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Agilent Technologies, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company") as of October 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income, of equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2024, including the related notes and schedule of valuation and qualifying accounts for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2024 appearing under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 
 
 In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of October 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. 
 
 Basis for Opinions 
 
 The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 
 Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
 
 As described in Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management has excluded BIOVECTRA from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2024 because it was acquired by the Company in a purchase business combination during 2024. We have also excluded BIOVECTRA from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. BIOVECTRA is a wholly-owned subsidiary whose total assets and total revenues excluded from management s assessment and our audit of internal control over financial reporting represent 3 and less than 1 , respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended October 31, 2024. 
 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit 
 58 

preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 
 Acquisition of BIOVECTRA Valuation of Certain Customer Relationships 
 
 As described in Notes 1, 3 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements, on September 20, 2024, the Company acquired 100 percent of the stock of BIOVECTRA for total consideration paid of 915 million in cash. As of October 31, 2024, gross carrying amount of customer relationships includes approximately 165 million related to BIOVECTRA which was valued by management using the multi-period excess earnings method under the income approach which values the customer relationships by discounting the direct cash flow expected to be generated by the customers. Of the customer relationships related to BIOVECTRA, the majority relates to certain customer relationships. Management s determination of the fair value of customer relationships acquired involved significant estimates and assumptions related to revenue growth rates, discount rates, and customer attrition rates. 
 
 The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of certain customer relationships acquired in the acquisition of BIOVECTRA is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when estimating the fair value of certain customer relationships acquired; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management s significant assumption related to revenue growth rates; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. 
 
 Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the acquisition accounting, including controls over management s valuation of certain customer relationships acquired. These procedures also included, among others (i) reading the purchase agreement; (ii) testing management s process for estimating the fair value of certain customer relationships acquired; (iii) evaluating the appropriateness of the multi-period excess earnings method used by management; (iv) testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the multi-period excess earnings method; and (v) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumption used by management related to revenue growth rates. Evaluating management s assumption related to the revenue growth rates involved considering (i) the current performance of the BIOVECTRA business and (ii) whether the assumption was consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of the multi-period excess earnings method.

 impairment of goodwill. 
 
 In fiscal year 2024, we assessed goodwill impairment for our three reporting units which consisted of three segments: life sciences and applied markets, diagnostics and genomics and Agilent CrossLab. We performed a qualitative test for goodwill impairment of the three reporting units as of September 30, 2024, our annual impairment test date. Based on the results of our qualitative testing, there was no impairment of goodwill as of September 30, 2024. Each quarter we review the events and circumstances to determine if goodwill impairment is indicated. There was impairment of goodwill during the years ended October 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. 
 
 Purchased intangible assets consist primarily of acquired developed technologies, proprietary know-how, trademarks, and customer relationships and are amortized using the best estimate of the asset's useful life that reflect the pattern in which the economic benefits are consumed or used up or a straight-line method ranging from years to years. IPR D is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter. When the IPR D project is complete, it is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and is amortized over its estimated useful life. If an IPR D project is abandoned, Agilent will record a charge for the value of the related intangible asset to Agilent's consolidated statement of operations in the period it is abandoned. 
 
 Our indefinite-lived intangible assets are IPR D intangible assets. The accounting guidance allows a qualitative approach for testing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, similar to the issued impairment testing guidance for goodwill and allows the option to first assess qualitative factors (events and circumstances) that could have affected the significant inputs used in determining the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not (i.e., greater than 50 chance) that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. An organization may choose to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinite-lived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to calculating its fair value. As of October 31, 2024, we do t have any indefinite-lived intangible assets.

Other investments w ith readily determinable fair value consist of shares we own in a special fund and are reported at fair value, with gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value included in net income. Trading securities, which are comprised of mutual funds, bonds and other similar instruments and deferred compensation liabilities are reported at fair value, with gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value recognized currently in net income. Equity method investments are reported at the amount of the company s initial investment and adjusted each period for the company s share of the investee s income or loss and dividend paid. There are equity method investments as of October 31, 2024 and 2023. The company assesses investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an investment may not be recoverable.

The change in the fair value compared to carrying value in the year ended October 31, 2024, is primarily due to decreased market interest rates. The fair value was calculated from quoted prices which are primarily Level 1 inputs under the accounting guidance. The fair value of foreign currency contracts used for hedging purposes is estimated internally by using inputs tied to active markets. These inputs, for example, interest rate yield curves, foreign exchange rates, and forward and spot prices for currencies are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.

 million in cash. The acquisition expands our contract development and manufacturing organization. As a result of the acquisition, BIOVECTRA became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Agilent. Accordingly, the results of BIOVECTRA are included in Agilent's consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date. 
 
 The BIOVECTRA acquisition was accounted for in accordance with the authoritative accounting guidance. The acquired assets and assumed liabilities were recorded at their estimated fair values. We determined the estimated fair values with the assistance of appraisals or valuations performed by third party specialists, discounted cash flow analyses, and estimates made by management. We expect to realize revenue synergies, leverage and expand the existing sales channels and product development resources, and utilize the assembled workforce. These factors, among others, contributed to a purchase price in excess of the estimated fair value of BIOVECTRA s net identifiable assets acquired (see summary of net assets below), and, as a result, we have recorded goodwill in connection with this transaction. 
 
 Goodwill acquired was allocated to our operating segments and reporting units as a part of the purchase price allocation. All goodwill was allocated to the diagnostics and genomics reporting unit. 
 
 Our acquisition of BIOVECTRA is treated as a stock acquisition and therefore is not deductible for United States federal tax purposes.

 Contract assets (unbilled accounts receivable) primarily relate to the company's right to consideration for work completed but not billed at the reporting date. The unbilled receivables are reclassified to trade receivables when billed to customers. Contract assets are generally classified as current assets and are included in "Accounts receivable, net" in the consolidated balance sheet.

 Contract liabilities primarily relate to multiple element arrangements for which billing has occurred but transfer of control of all elements to the customer has either partially or not occurred at the balance sheet date. This includes cash received from customers for products and related installation and services in advance of the transfer of control. Contract liabilities are classified as either current in deferred revenue or long-term in other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet based on the timing of when we expect to complete our performance obligation. 
 
 Contract Costs 
 
 Incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer are recognized as an asset if we expect the benefit of those costs to be longer than one year. We have determined that certain sales incentive programs meet the requirements to be capitalized. The changes in total capitalized costs to obtain a contract were immaterial during the years ended October 31, 2024 and 2023 and are included in other current and long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheet. We have applied the practical expedient to expense costs as incurred for costs to obtain a contract with a customer when the amortization period would have been one year or less. These costs include the company's internal sales force compensation program, as we have determined that annual compensation is commensurate with annual sales activities.

On November 15, 2017 and March 21, 2018, the Board of Directors and the stockholders, respectively, approved the Agilent Technologies, Inc. 2018 Stock Plan (the "2018 Plan") which amends, including renaming and extending the term of, the Agilent Technologies, Inc. 2009 Stock Plan (the "2009 Plan"). The 2018 Plan provides for the grant of awards in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights ("SARs"), restricted stock, restricted stock units ("RSUs"), performance shares and performance units with performance-based conditions on vesting or exercisability, and cash awards. The 2018 Plan has a term of . As of October 31, 2024, shares were available for future awards under the 2018 Plan. 
 
 Stock Options. In fiscal year 2021, we resumed granting stock options. Stock options granted under the 2018 Plan may be either "incentive stock options", as defined in Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code, or non-statutory. Options generally vest at a rate of percent per year over a period of from the date of grant with a maximum contractual term of . The exercise price for stock options is generally not less than percent of the fair market value of our common stock on the date the stock award is granted. We issue new shares of common stock when employee stock options are exercised. 
 
 Performance Shares. We have two LTPP performance stock award programs, which are administered under the 2018 Stock Plan, for our executive officers and other key employees. Participants in our LTPP Total Stockholders Return TSR and LTPP Earnings Per Share EPS programs are entitled to receive shares of the company's stock after the end of a three-year period, if specified performance targets for the programs are met. The LTPP-TSR awards are generally designed to meet the criteria of a performance award with the performance metrics and peer group comparison based on the TSR set at the beginning of the performance period. The LTPP-EPS awards are based on the company s EPS performance over a three-year period. The performance targets for the LTPP-EPS for year 2 and year 3 of the performance period are set in the first quarter of year 2 and year 3, respectively. All LTPP awards are subject to a one-year post-vest holding period. The final LTPP award may vary from to percent of the target award. The maximum contractual term for awards under the LTPP program is . We consider the dilutive impact of these programs in our diluted net income per share calculation only to the extent that the performance conditions are expected to be met. 
 
 Restricted Stock Units. We also issue restricted stock units under our share-based plans. The estimated fair value of the restricted stock unit awards granted under the Stock Plans is determined based on the market price of Agilent's common stock on the date of grant adjusted for expected dividend yield. Restricted stock units generally vest, with some exceptions, at a rate of percent per year over a period of from the date of grant. All restricted stock units granted to our executives after November 1, 2015, are subject to a one-year post-vest holding period.

 At October 31, 2024 and 2023, share-based compensation was capitalized within inventory. 
 
 Valuation Assumptions 
 
 The fair value of share-based awards for our employee stock option awards was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Shares granted under the LTPP (TSR) were valued using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The Monte Carlo simulation fair value model requires the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions, including the price volatility of the underlying stock. For the volatility of our LTPP (TSR) grants, we used our own historical stock price volatility. 
 
 The ESPP allows eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock at percent of the price at purchase and uses the purchase date to establish the fair market value. 
 
 We use historical volatility to estimate the expected stock price volatility assumption for employee stock option awards. In reaching the conclusion, we have considered many factors including the extent to which our options are currently traded and our ability to find traded options in the current market with similar terms and prices to the options we are valuing. In estimating the expected life of our options granted, we considered the historical option exercise behavior of our executives, which we believe is representative of future behavior. 
 
 The estimated fair value of restricted stock units and LTPP (EPS) awards is determined based on the market price of our common stock on the date of grant adjusted for expected dividend yield. The compensation cost for LTPP (EPS) reflects the cost of awards that are probable to vest at the end of the performance period. 
 
 All LTPP awards granted to our senior management employees have a one-year post-vest holding restriction. The estimated discount associated with post-vest holding restrictions is calculated using the Finnerty model. The model calculates the potential lost value if the employees were able to sell the shares during the lack of marketability period, instead of being required to hold the shares. The model used the same historical stock price volatility and dividend yield assumption used for the Monte Carlo simulation model and an expected dividend yield to compute the discount.

 The dilutive effect of share-based awards is reflected in diluted net income per share by application of the treasury stock method, which includes consideration of unamortized share-based compensation expense and the dilutive effect of in-the-money options and non-vested restricted stock units. Under the treasury stock method, the amount the employee must pay for exercising stock options and unamortized share-based compensation expense collectively are assumed proceeds to be used to repurchase hypothetical shares. An increase in the fair market value of the company's common stock can result in a greater dilutive effect from potentially dilutive awards. 
 
 We exclude stock options with exercise prices greater than the average market price of our common stock from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because their effect would be anti-dilutive. In addition, we exclude from the calculation of diluted earnings per share, stock options, ESPP, LTPP and restricted stock awards whose combined exercise price and unamortized fair value collectively were greater than the average market price of our common stock because their effect would also be anti-dilutive. 
 
 In 2024, 2023 and 2022, we issued share-based awards of approximately million, million and million, respectively.

 Our money market funds and trading securities are generally valued using quoted market prices and therefore are classified within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Our derivative financial instruments are classified within level 2, as there is not an active market for each hedge contract, but the inputs used to calculate the value of the instruments are tied to active markets. Our deferred compensation liability is classified as level 2 because, although the values are not directly based on quoted market prices, the inputs used in the calculations are observable.

These foreign exchange contracts are carried at fair value and are designated and qualify as net investment hedges under the criteria prescribed in the authoritative guidance. Changes in fair value of the effective portion of the derivative instrument are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)- translation adjustment and are assessed for effectiveness against the underlying exposure every reporting period. If the company s net investment changes during the year, the hedge relationship will be assessed and de-designated if the hedge notional amount is outside of prescribed tolerance with a gain/loss reclassified from other comprehensive income (loss) to other income (expense) in the current period. For the years ended October 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, ineffectiveness and the resultant effect of any gains or losses recognized in other income (expense) due to de-designation of the hedge contracts were not significant. 
 
 Other Hedges 
 
 Additionally, we enter into foreign exchange contracts to hedge monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries. These foreign exchange contracts are carried at fair value and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and are not designated as hedging instruments. Changes in value of the derivative instruments are recognized in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations, in the current period, along with the offsetting foreign currency gain or loss on the underlying assets or liabilities. 
 
 Our use of derivative instruments exposes us to credit risk to the extent that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreement. We do, however, seek to mitigate such risks by limiting our counterparties to major financial institutions which are selected based on their credit ratings and other factors. We have established policies and procedures for mitigating credit risk that include establishing counterparty credit limits, monitoring credit exposures, and continually assessing the creditworthiness of counterparties. 
 
 A number of our derivative agreements contain threshold limits to the net liability position with counterparties and are dependent on our corporate credit rating determined by the major credit rating agencies. The counterparties to the derivative instruments may request collateralization, in accordance with derivative agreements, on derivative instruments in net liability positions.

Approximately percent of the retirement and post-retirement plans consists of limited partnerships. The general investment objective for all our plan assets is to obtain the optimum rate of investment return on the total investment portfolio consistent with the assumption of a reasonable level of risk. Specific investment objectives for the plans' portfolios are to: maintain and enhance the purchasing power of the plans' assets; achieve investment returns consistent with the level of risk being taken; and earn performance rates of return in accordance with the benchmarks adopted for each asset class. Outside the U.S., our target asset allocation (excluding annuity contracts in the U.K.) ranges from to percent to equities, from percent to percent to fixed income investments, and from to percent to real estate, depending on the plan.

Portions of the cash and cash equivalent, equity, and fixed income investments are held in commingled funds that are valued using Net Asset Value NAV as the practical expedient. In addition, some of the investments valued using NAV as the practical expedient may have limits on their redemption to weekly or monthly and/or may require prior written notice specified by each fund. In December 2021, we entered into an insurance buy-in contract for a portion of the benefit obligations under the U.K. defined benefit plan which was funded from existing pension plan assets without any adjustment to the benefit obligations. In December 2023, we entered into another insurance buy-in contract for the remaining portion of benefit obligations under the same plan which was also funded from existing pension plan assets with no adjustment made to the benefit obligations. These have been classified as Annuity Contracts since the insurance buy-in contract is similar to an annuity contract. They match cash flows with future benefit payments for participants as of the contract date with the obligation remaining with the plan. Both contracts are issued by the same third-party insurance company with no affiliation to us. 
 
 Fair Value. The measurement of the fair value of pension and post-retirement plan assets uses the valuation methodologies and the inputs as described in Note 13, "Fair Value Measurements". 
 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents - Cash and cash equivalents consist of short-term investment funds. The funds also invest in short-term domestic fixed income securities and other securities with debt-like characteristics emphasizing short-term maturities and quality. Some of our cash and cash equivalents are held in commingled funds. Other cash and cash equivalents are generally classified as Level 2 investments. 
 
 Equity - This consists of equity securities which have quoted prices in active markets and has been classified as Level 1 investments. 
 
 Fixed Income - Some of the fixed income securities are not actively traded and are valued at quoted prices based on the terms of the security and comparison to similar securities traded on an active market; these are classified as Level 2 investments. Securities which have quoted prices in active markets are classified as Level 1 investments. 
 
 Real Estate - Real estate securities include holdings of managed investment funds which invest primarily in the equity instruments of real estate investment trust and other similar real estate investments. Since the existing securities have quoted prices in active markets, it has been classified as level 1 and grouped with equity. 
 
 Annuity Contract This consists of the U.K. insurance buy-in contracts. Since they are valued on an insurer pricing basis, which reflects the purchase price adjusted for changes in discount rates and other actuarial assumptions which approximates fair value, they have been classified as level 3. 
 
 Other Investments - Other investments also include partnership investments where, due to their private nature, pricing inputs are not readily observable. Asset valuations are developed by the general partners that manage the partnerships. These valuations are based on proprietary appraisals, application of public market multiples to private company cash flows, utilization

The expected long-term return on assets below represents an estimate of long-term returns on investment portfolios consisting of a mixture of equities, fixed income and alternative investments in proportion to the asset allocations of each of our plans. We consider long-term rates of return, which are weighted based on the asset classes (both historical and forecasted) in which we expect our pension and post-retirement funds to be invested. Discount rates reflect the current rate at which pension and post-retirement obligations could be settled based on the measurement dates of the plans - October 31.

Fiscal Year 2024 Plan ("FY24 Plan") 
 
 In the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, we initiated a new restructuring plan designed to further reduce costs and expenses in response to current macroeconomic conditions. The plan includes a reduction of our total headcount by approximately regular employees, representing approximately percent of our global workforce. 
 
 In connection with the FY24 Plan, we have recorded restructuring expenses of million in fiscal year 2024. The costs associated with this workforce reduction include severance, accelerated share-based compensation expense and other personnel-related costs. The timing and scope of the workforce reductions will vary based on local legal requirements. While the majority of the workforce reduction was completed in fiscal year 2024, we expect to substantially complete the remaining restructuring activities by the end of the second quarter of fiscal year 2025.

 Guarantees consist primarily of outstanding standby letters of credit and bank guarantees and were approximately million and million as of October 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. A standby letter of credit is a guarantee of payment issued by a bank on behalf of us that is used as payment of last resort should we fail to fulfill a contractual commitment with a third party. A bank guarantee is a promise from a bank or other lending institution that if we default on a loan, the bank will cover the loss. 
 
 Indemnifications in Connection with Transactions 
 
 In connection with various divestitures, acquisitions, spin-offs and other transactions, we have agreed to indemnify certain parties, their affiliates and/or other related parties against certain damages and expenses that might occur in the future. These indemnifications may cover a variety of liabilities, including, but not limited to, employee, tax, environmental, intellectual property, litigation and other liabilities related to the business conducted prior to the date of the transaction. In our opinion, the fair value of these indemnification obligations was not material as of October 31, 2024. 
 
 Indemnifications to Officers and Directors 
 
 Our corporate bylaws require that we indemnify our officers and directors, as well as those who act as directors and officers of other entities at our request, against expenses, judgments, fines, settlements and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any proceedings arising out of their services to Agilent and such other entities, including service with respect to employee benefit plans. In addition, we have entered into separate indemnification agreements with each director and each board-appointed officer of Agilent which provide for indemnification of these directors and officers under similar circumstances and under additional circumstances. The indemnification obligations are more fully described in the bylaws and the indemnification agreements. We purchase standard insurance to cover claims or a portion of the claims made against our directors and officers. Since a maximum obligation is not explicitly stated in our bylaws or in our indemnification agreements and will depend on the facts and circumstances that arise out of any future claims, the overall maximum amount of the obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. Historically, we have not made payments related to these obligations, and the fair value for these indemnification obligations was not material as of October 31, 2024.

 The Agilent CrossLab business spans the entire lab with its extensive services portfolio, which is designed to improve customer outcomes. The majority of the portfolio is vendor neutral, meaning we can serve and supply customers regardless of their instrument purchase choices. The services portfolio includes repairs, parts, maintenance, installations, training, compliance support, software as a service, asset management, consulting and various other custom services to support the customers' laboratory operations. Custom services are tailored to meet the specific application needs of various industries and to keep instruments fully operational and compliant with the respective industry requirements. 
 
 A significant portion of the segments' expenses arises from shared services and infrastructure that we have historically provided to the segments in order to realize economies of scale and to efficiently use resources. These expenses, collectively called corporate charges, include finance, tax, treasury, legal, real estate, insurance services, workplace services, human resources, information technology services, corporate development and other corporate infrastructure expenses, costs of centralized research and development and joint sales and marketing costs. Charges are allocated to the segments, and the allocations have been determined on a basis that we consider to be a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services provided to or benefits received by the segments. In addition, we do not allocate certain costs to the operating margin for each segment because management does not include this information in its measurement of the performance of the operating segments. Unallocated costs consist of asset impairments, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, acquisition and integration costs, changes in the fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration, transformational initiatives expenses,

 None. 

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our management has evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of October 31, 2024, pursuant to and as required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Exchange Act ). Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of October 31, 2024, the company's disclosure controls and procedures, as defined by Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act, were effective and designed to ensure that (i) information required to be disclosed in the company's reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and (ii) information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 
 Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO"). As a result of that assessment, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of October 31, 2024, based on criteria in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. 
 
 SEC staff guidance discusses the exclusion of an acquired business s internal controls from management s annual assessment of the internal controls over financial reporting when it is not possible to conduct assessments for the acquired business in the period between the acquisition date and the date of management s assessment. The company completed the acquisition of BIOVECTRA on September 20, 2024. Management excluded BIOVECTRA from its assessment of the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2024. BIOVECTRA constituted less than 1 percent of total revenue for the period ending October 31, 2024 and 3 percent of total assets, excluding acquired goodwill and other intangible assets, as of October 31, 2024. 
 
 The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2024 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during Agilent's last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Item 9B. Other Information

Exhibit 19.1 
 Insider Trading Policy 
 General Prohibition on Trading While in Possession of Material Non-Public Information 
 If you possess information about Agilent that is both material and non-public, you are subject to trading restrictions. You and your immediate family 1 cannot legally trade in Agilent securities (including options, put or call options, forward contracts, warrants, swaps and other derivative securities tied to any of the foregoing), disclose such information to anyone, including your family, friends and colleagues, who may buy or sell securities because of the information, or make recommendations to anyone about trading in Agilent securities while in possession of material and non-public information about Agilent. 
 Information is material if it would influence a reasonable person to buy or sell securities, would be likely to be used as part an investment decision regarding securities or is reasonably likely to affect the market price of securities to which the information relates, as applicable. Examples include undisclosed data reflecting orders, sales, earnings or profitability, or trends in these figures impending announcements of major new products major Agilent acquisitions, equity investments or divestitures pending public offerings or private sales of debt equity securities senior management changes major physical or digital security breaches and important developments in projects, alliances or litigation. 
 Information is non-public if it has not been the subject of an Agilent press release or SEC filing disclosing such information or has otherwise not been widely disseminated to the public. 
 Trading Window Restrictions 
 In addition to the general restriction described above, directors, officers and other Agilent employees who have access to certain financial information are prohibited from trading when the earnings trading window is closed. The earnings trading window generally opens at the market open on the second trading day after the public announcement of earnings and ends at market close on the last trading day of the second month of Agilent s fiscal quarter (e.g., if Agilent releases earnings for the quarter ended October 31 on November 25, then the earnings trading window would open at the market open on November 27 and close on the last trading day in December). 2 However, please note that the dates for earnings releases may change on very short notice. In addition, the trading window may be shortened or eliminated under certain circumstances, of which any affected persons would be notified. 
 What Constitutes Trading in Agilent Securities 
 Trading in Agilent securities includes buying or selling Agilent shares in the open market selling shares that were purchased under the Agilent employee stock purchase plan or issued upon exercise of an Agilent employee stock option, gifts of Agilent shares and net settlement of equity awards to fund tax or exercise price obligations. 
 Prohibited trading does not include purchases of Agilent stock through the Agilent employee stock purchase plan or purchases, without sale, of shares through exercise of an Agilent employee stock option. 
 
 1 The term immediate family means your spouse, parents, natural and adopted children (or other minor dependents), siblings, mothers- and fathers- in-law, sons- and daughters-in-law and brothers- and sisters-in-law, no matter where they reside, as well as any individuals residing in your household. These individuals are included because securities laws will generally presume that they obtained material non-public information from the insider, unless the insider is able to successfully prove that the person obtained the information from another source.

 (Revised in December 2024) 

Written Trading Plans and Limit Orders 
 The foregoing restrictions on trading, including the earnings trading window restrictions, do not apply to transactions which are executed pursuant to the terms of a pre-approved Rule 10b5-1 trading plan. All Rule 10b5-1 plans must be pre-approved by the Corporate Secretary or Assistant Secretary and entered into when the earnings trading window is open and when the employee is not aware of any material nonpublic information. All Rule 10b5-1 trading plans must comply with Rule 10b5-1(c) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. It is the Company s general policy to approve the use of Rule 10b5-1 trading plans by those employees who are subject to the earnings trading window restrictions, or who otherwise as a result of their position with the Company, are regularly in possession of material inside information. 
 There is no exception from the restrictions on insider trading and trading window restrictions for trades made under outstanding limit orders. Therefore, you must cancel any automatic orders that do not constitute Rule 10b5-1 trading plans during periods when you are subject to any insider trading restrictions. 
 Restrictions on Hedging and Other Transactions 
 Agilent policy restricts directors, officers and other employees from engaging in hedging transactions, such as purchasing or writing derivative securities including puts and calls, prepaid variable forward contracts and entering into short sales or short positions, with respect to Agilent securities. Also, Agilent policy restricts directors and executive officers from buying Agilent stock on margin or pledging owned Agilent shares as collateral for loans or other indebtedness. 
 Penalties for Insider Trading Violations 
 If you violate insider trading laws, both you and Agilent may be subject to severe penalties, including criminal penalties. You may also be liable for trading by your spouse, family members or others who trade on material non-public information disclosed by you. U.S. insider trading laws apply to all Agilent employees at any level, not merely to directors, officers or managers. U.S. insider trading laws apply to Agilent employees outside the U.S. who trade Agilent securities in the U.S. They apply to all transactions in Agilent securities. 
 Similar laws in other countries may apply to trading by Agilent employees who are located in those countries, or to trades in exchanges that are located there. Most of Europe is covered by insider trading restrictions under an EU directive and parallel national legislation. 
 Separate and apart from any criminal penalties, employees who violate Agilent s insider trading policies are subject to disciplinary action, which may include termination of employment. 
 Additional Information 
 In addition, Agilent is also prohibited from trading in Agilent securities based upon material non-public information about itself, consistent with applicable law. 
 If you have any questions regarding Agilent s insider trading policies or procedures, please contact the Corporate Secretary or Assistant Secretary.

Exhibit 97.1 
 AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION CLAWBACK POLICY

Notwithstanding the foregoing, compensation amounts shall only be considered Excess Awarded Compensation for purposes of the Policy if such compensation is Received (i) while the Company has a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange or a national securities association and (ii) on or after October 2, 2023.

 (u) Restatement Date means the earlier to occur of (i) the date that the Board, a committee of the Board, or an officer or officers of the Company authorized to take such action if Board action is not required, concludes, or reasonably should have concluded, that the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement or (ii) the date a court, regulator, or other legally authorized body directs the Company to prepare an Accounting Restatement. 
 (v) Transition Period means any transition period that results from a change in the Company s Fiscal Year within or immediately following the three (3) completed Fiscal Years immediately preceding the Restatement Date. 
 3. Administration . This Policy shall be administered by the Committee. The Committee has full authority to interpret, construe and enforce this Policy and to make all determinations necessary, appropriate, or advisable for the administration of this Policy. Any determinations made by the Committee shall be final, conclusive and binding on all interested 

parties and need not be uniform with respect to each individual covered by this Policy. Any members of the Committee, and any other members of the Board who assist in the administration of this Policy, shall not be personally liable for any action, determination or interpretation made with respect to this Policy and shall be fully indemnified by the Company to the fullest extent under applicable law and Company policy with respect to any such action, determination or interpretation. The foregoing sentence shall not limit any other rights to indemnification of the members of the Board under applicable law or Company policy. 
 
 4. Recovery of Excess Awarded Compensation . 
 (a) Recovery of Excess Awarded Compensation . In the event of an Accounting Restatement, the Committee shall reasonably promptly determine the amount of any Excess Awarded Compensation for each Covered Executive Officer in connection with such Accounting Restatement and shall promptly thereafter provide each Covered Executive Officer with a written notice identifying the amount of Excess Awarded Compensation and a demand for repayment or return, as applicable. 
 (b) Forms of Recovery . The Committee shall determine, in its sole discretion, and in a manner that effectuates the purpose of the Clawback Rule and the Listing Rule, the method(s) for recovering any Excess Awarded Compensation hereunder in accordance with Section 4(a) above, which may include (i) requiring cash reimbursement (ii) seeking recovery or forfeiture of any gain realized on the vesting, exercise, settlement, sale, transfer or other disposition of any equity-based awards (iii) offsetting the amount to be recouped from any compensation otherwise owed by the Company to the applicable Covered Executive Officer (iv) cancelling outstanding vested or unvested equity awards or (v) taking any other remedial and recovery action permitted by law, as determined by the Committee. Any reduction, cancellation or forfeiture of any compensation shall be done in compliance with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. For the avoidance of doubt, except as set forth in Section 4(e) below, in no event may the Company Group accept an amount that is less than the amount of Excess Awarded Compensation in satisfaction of a Covered Executive Officer s obligations hereunder. 
 (c) Covered Executive Officer s Failure to Repay . If a Covered Executive Officer fails to repay all Excess Awarded Compensation to the Company Group when due (as determined in accordance with Section 4(b) above), the Company shall, or shall cause one or more other members of the Company Group to, take all actions reasonable and appropriate to recover such Excess Awarded Compensation from the applicable Covered Executive Officer (including suing for repayment and or enforcing such Covered Executive Officer s obligation to make payment through the reduction or cancellation of outstanding and future compensation). The applicable Covered Executive Officer shall be required to reimburse the Company Group for any and all expenses reasonably incurred (including legal fees) by the Company Group in recovering such Excess Awarded Compensation in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence. 

(d) No Indemnification . No member of the Company Group shall be permitted to indemnify any Covered Executive Officer against (i) the loss of any Excess Awarded Compensation that is repaid, returned or recovered pursuant to the terms of this Policy, or (ii) any claims relating to the Company s enforcement of its rights under this Policy (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any advancement of costs related to such enforcement). Further, no member of the Company Group shall enter into any agreement that exempts any Performance-Based Compensation from the application of this Policy or that waives the Company s right to recovery of any Excess Awarded Compensation and this Policy shall supersede any such agreement (whether entered into before, on or after the Effective Date). 
 (e) Exceptions to Recovery . Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company shall not be required to take the actions contemplated by Section 4(b) above if the following conditions are met and the Committee determines that recovery would be impracticable 
 (i) The direct expenses paid to a third party to assist in enforcing the Policy against a Covered Executive Officer would exceed the amount to be recovered, after the Company has made a reasonable attempt to recover the applicable Excess Awarded Compensation, and the Committee has documented such attempt(s) and provided such documentation to the Exchange 
 (ii) Recovery would violate the home country law of the Company, where that law was adopted prior to November 28, 2022, provided that, before determining that it would be impracticable to recover any amount of Excess Awarded Compensation based on violation of home country law, the Company has obtained an opinion of home country counsel, acceptable to the Exchange, that recovery would result in such a violation and a copy of the opinion is provided to the Exchange or 
 (iii) Recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly available to employees of the Company Group, to fail to meet the requirements of 26 U.S.C. 401(a)(13), and the regulations thereunder, or 26 U.S.C. 411(a), and the regulations thereunder. 
 5. Amendment Termination . The Committee shall amend this Policy as it deems necessary, including as and when it determines that it is legally required by any federal securities laws (including the Clawback Rule), Commission rule or the Listing Rule. The Committee may terminate this Policy at any time in its discretion. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5 to the contrary, no amendment or termination of this Policy shall be effective if such amendment or termination would (after taking into account any actions taken by the Company contemporaneously with such amendment or termination) cause the Company to violate any United States securities laws (including the Clawback Rule), Commission rule or the Listing Rule. This Policy automatically shall terminate upon a Change in Control (as defined in the Company s 2018 Stock Plan, as amended) (or any successor thereto), which results in the Company s securities no longer being traded on an established securities exchange. 

6. Inducement of Executive Officers . The Committee may require that any employment agreement, equity award agreement, or any other agreement entered into on or after the Effective Date shall, as a condition to the grant of any benefit thereunder, require an Executive Officer to agree to abide by the terms of this Policy. 
 7. Filing Requirements . The Company shall file all disclosures with respect to this Policy in accordance with the requirements of the U.S. federal securities laws, including disclosures required by Commission filings. 
 8. Non-Exclusivity . Any right of recoupment under this Policy is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies or rights of recoupment that may be available to the Company Group under applicable law, regulation or rule or pursuant to the terms of any similar policy, in any employment agreement, equity award agreement, or similar agreement and any other legal remedies available to the Company Group provided, however , that any amounts recouped under any other policy that are subject to clawback under this Policy shall be considered recovered by the Company Group for purposes of this Policy and vice versa. 
 9. Effective Date . This Policy shall be effective as of the Effective Date. 
 10. Successors . This Policy shall be binding and enforceable against all Covered Executive Officers and their beneficiaries, heirs, executors, administrators or other legal representatives.
